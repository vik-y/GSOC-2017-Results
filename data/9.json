Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nMany users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/e6UifH3TR9p8a-8sKngoEkMHw_0yJ1ssFPNN1WH-gkUOHdRwf_qU-O5UVhN3co1AZzrI7atjqYKTtl6p-z6sKq65rRanTg","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":"http://www.r-bloggers.com/","application_instructions":"1. look for a project on\nhttps://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2017/wiki/table-of-proposed-coding-projects\n\n2.

Collecting this data can help Terasology make the decision of what kind of optimisation could be made as well as help Terasology provide more fun for users.\nThe metric & error reporting will be implemented via two ways : for error reporting, a logback appender will be implemented to track exceptions locally and send error to the server, logstash will be used by server to collect the error reports; for metric events, Snowplow tools  will be used to collecting custom metric events.

LibreOffice is compatible with many file formats like Microsoft® Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. At its heart though, LibreOffice is built around an open standard, the OpenDocument Format, as its native file format.\n\nLibreOffice is developed by users who, just like you, believe in the principles of Free Software and in sharing their work with the world in non-restrictive ways. The development of LibreOffice is supported by The Document Foundation which provides the infrastructure for the project.\n\nWe believe that users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software that we distribute. While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.\n\nThough the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution & skills.\n\nThe community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations. With tons of different roles in the project, we invite everyone to join us in our work and help us to make LibreOffice known, prosper, and accessible to all.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/oKFpzxvkUYRiTW0UKnMh-BD2nvvLpS3aMuXWDlE-3qTeM0cL2Kgi9z_O0aqji79LN1qxUUsMY2SMz7BMXx_a6itPOUNTRg","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":"https://plus.google.com/+libreoffice/posts","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/libreoffice","blog_url":"https://blog.documentfoundation.org/","application_instructions":"First you should have a look at the Google Summer of Code FAQ and GSoC Student Guide.

A registered callback function is then called back for every packet that traverses the respective hook within the network stack.\n\niptables is a generic table structure for the definition of rulesets. Each rule within an IP table consists of a number of classifiers (iptables matches) and one connected action (iptables target).\n\nnetfilter, ip_tables, connection tracking (ip_conntrack, nf_conntrack) and the NAT subsystem together build the major parts of the framework.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ctLHtqKxleIySCn3QkBYiJAkr4nqV8t8K7Yylg01TyxcD-1DvOWRhlF_tXEzPQo4sRWLaB_FuawNlKmotZ39RxWgpLAjew","image_bg_color":"FFFFFF","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/nftables","blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"General requirements for students to participate are:\n\n* must know C, writing code fluently.\n* Good knowledge on Linux networking, through command line tooling.\n* Computer networking at a good level, more specifically, layer 2/3/4 of TCP/IP stack.","topic_tags":["firewall","networking"],"technology_tags":["linux","kernel","c"],"proposal_tags":["new features","bugfixing"],"ideas_list":"http://people.netfilter.org/pablo/nf-ideas-2017.txt","contact_method":"pablo@netfilter.org","program_year":2017},"student":{"id":5284871227310080,"display_name":"Shyam Saini","program_year":2017},"abstract":"I'm interested in proposed **Task 1 : Implement missing features in nftables**.

It also adds a weight normalization option to the LCMV beamformer (neural activity index and unit noise gain), which will be available for other LCMV versions as well.\nFurthermore, statistical testing of the Hilbert beamformer output using the Wilcoxon rank sum test will be implemented to complete the new Hilbert beamformer pipeline. Due to the size of the MEG data and intensiveness of the calculations, the code will be developed with memory efficiency and parallelization in mind.\nInteractive visualization of source-localized time frequency representations will complete the Hilbert beamformer routine.","assignee_display_names":["Denis Engemann","agramfort"],"program_year":2017},{"id":5331987152764928,"title":"Mobile App for Carbon Footprint","subcategory":"carbon footprint","organization":{"id":4724897470218240,"name":"AOSSIE - Australian Open Source Software Innovation and Education","slug":"aossie-australian-open-source-software-innovation-and-education","website_url":"http://www.aossie.org/","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"","mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/aossie-gsoc-2017","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"Umbrella Org for Open-Source Projects in Australia","precis":"The umbrella organization for open-source projects developed in Australia.","description":"We are a not-for-profit umbrella organization for open-source projects developed in Australia.

Users of _ns-3_ can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in _ns-3_ is the high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds.  Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.\n\nProject details\n===========\n_ns-3_ has been in development since 2006 and has made 26 releases (ns-3.26 in October 2016).  _ns-3_ models are written in C++, with Python bindings and Python-based build tools.  The tool is in wide use in the field; we provide statistics about the project on our [web site](https://www.nsnam.org/overview/statistics/), but in summary, the community includes over 7000 people subscribed to our users forum, 1500 people subscribed to our developers mailing list, 200 recognized code contributors, and about 12 active maintainers.  The project's impact on the field is high:  the number of annual academic publications citing use of _ns-3_ is an imprecise count but appears to range in the several hundreds per year based on our searching of IEEE and ACM digital libraries and Google Scholar.

The current implementation of LTE does not have support of IPv6 in ns-3. So, the idea of testing MIPv6 code into LTE would follow IPv6 support implementation in LTE first and then the MIPv6 support. So, ns-3 researchers can benefit themselves with the addition of this feature. \nThus, implementation of MIPv6 in ns-3 as the base mobility management solution and providing LTE support within it could help the current network researchers working on ns-3.","assignee_display_names":["Tommaso Pecorella"],"program_year":2017},{"id":4809191788118016,"title":"Mobile-Based Blood-Sample Image Analysis(iOS)","subcategory":"computational biology","organization":{"id":5710059888705536,"name":"Computational Biology @ University of Nebraska-Lincoln","slug":"computational-biology-university-of-nebraska-lincoln","website_url":"http://helikarlab.org","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"helikarlab-gsoc@googlegroups.com","mailing_list":null,"irc_channel":null,"tagline":"Development of software technologies for biomedical research and applications.","precis":"Our organization develops tools for bioinformatics and computational biology research.

The goal is to be able to import seamlessly an extension deployed for example on Pypi in the same way as it's done e.g. using Maven repository. And so, since, for example,  Pypi is the repository storing .egg and .whl packages, there will be a need to implement integration between .egg/.whl packages and XWiki (possibly converting them to JAR and using Jython).\n\nWhen the project is done, the benefit of it will be wider possibilities to create, deploy and import extensions to XWiki.","assignee_display_names":["Thomas Mortagne","polx"],"program_year":2017},{"id":6223909119590400,"title":"Mozilla Science Lab: science.mozilla.org phase 2","subcategory":"new features","organization":{"id":6421332469219328,"name":"Mozilla","slug":"mozilla","website_url":"https://www.mozilla.org/","category":"web","contact_email":"gsoc-mentors@mozilla.com","mailing_list":"","irc_channel":"https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC","tagline":"Internet for people, not profit.","precis":"We’re Mozilla, the proudly non-profit champions of the Internet, helping to keep it healthy, open and accessible to all.","description":"Our mission is to ensure the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all.

A particular focus of the group is on the integration of individual methods into complete cognition-enabled robot control systems and the release of the developed software as open-source libraries.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 2-Clause \"Simplified\" or \"FreeBSD\" License (BSD-2-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/TleF7-ZIkIUiWDxvaPndQFpqX3_R1lGZGDxaCxNTcvT3X7uLKbBPWZPfVln4itkDtCBnpAlagG2bEaMr0t0ZD8uyvQbUw4du","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/IAI_Bremen","blog_url":"http://ai.uni-bremen.de","application_instructions":"When applying for a topic, please make sure you carefully read the description of the topic description you are interested in posted [here](https://ai.uni-bremen.de/teaching/gsoc2017).

The HEP Software Foundation (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing. \n\nCERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, http://www.cern.ch) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as CERN-SFT group that provides common software for CERN's experiments. This year the program has expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator  http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments have announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: detector and accelerator simulation (Falcon, Geant4, GeantV, Pythia, SixTrack), data analysis (ROOT, TMVA, scikit-HEP, Go-HEP), event reconstruction (CMS Tracking), data management (transfer2go) and many others.

It uses a combination of CNN-RNN (Convolutional-Recurrent Neural Network), 3D convolutions (C3D) and audio features, as shown in the winning solution of EmotiW 2016 competition. A special RNN called LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is used to learn the motion by taking the individual features of each image frame, extracted by the CNN. The 3D convolutional network, works in a way such that it takes care of the image as well as flow of the video (appearance and motion). For extracting the audio features, it uses the OpenSmile toolkit. The EmotiW dataset is used for training this network. The goal of this project is to give an API which will take a video from the user and returns the output regarding the characteristics of emotion.

People should be able to walk up to any smart device - a vending machine, a poster, a toy, a bus stop, a rental car - and not have to download an app first. Everything should be just a tap away.\n\nThe number of smart devices is going to explode, and the assumption that each new device will require its own application just isn’t realistic. We need a system that lets anyone interact with any device at any time. The Physical Web isn’t about replacing native apps: it’s about enabling interaction when native apps just aren’t practical.\n\nThe Physical Web Project is the Google Summer of Code proposal for university students interested in developing applications around that technology. The Physical Web Project, while making use of Physical Web software, does not develop the Physical Web code-base itself. Physical Web is an open standard that everyone can use. By creating a common web standard that any device can use to offer interaction, a new range of services becomes possible. Instead, the Physical Web Project works on extending the Physical Web system with open source software enabling open source applications.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/5iSCmtWMuF8ChlKbH5urNkcXh3X-Gajm65_dIg8EshD85otOAVt23UvgPztwXiT6iwA3v1H3mIOfYm_RGARCjxaoqOio2KU","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"If you want to make a proposal as student, point your browser to the main GSoC 2017 site and follow the instructions there to register as student.

The main objective of the project, called **ProvinciaWiFi** (later renamed [WiFi Metropolitano](http://www.cittametropolitanaroma.gov.it/index.php/wifimetropolitano-english-version)), was to take a decisive step to reduce the existing **digital divide** by fostering and facilitating the use of ICT by citizens.\nFrom the outset it was decided to commit the project to a completely open philosophy. For this reason a clear choice towards open software and operating systems and the availability of every modification, update and improvement to the community was made. The same approach was adopted for the knowledge and the experience acquired within the project. In order to pursue this goals the Province of Rome called the university consortium *CASPUR* (later merged in the [CINECA](https://www.cineca.it/en) consortium) to develop the technical solution. In this context, a research project conducted by the *CINECA* consortium found its perfect application. This project proposed an innovative methodology for the distribution of networks (more precisely Virtual LANs used for Wi-Fi connectivity) between geographically distant sites. \n\nThe methodology adopted made it possible to host public connectivity services on non-dedicated network infrastructures (e.g.: private xDSL) that for technical and legal reasons could not be used as such. \u2028This is not the sole advantage that OpenWISP gave to *WiFi Metropolitano*: embracing the resource-sharing philosophy – typical of open projects – anyone can contribute to the network expansion simply by hosting an access point.\n\n\u2028The software tools and the architectures, including the OpenWISP 2 [wifi controller](http://openwisp.org/whatis.html#wifi-controller) and different [NetJSON](http://netjson.org/) implementations used in OpenWISP,  are released to the public free of charge under open-source licenses, we hope this will allow a broader audience to benefit from this work and improve upon it.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/pNekwasncafkQ2pz4_5TwyxaZHDyy1AU6rHJ-FFGNzL0Fag6orGBoWECJmHQ_wxWkAb0GhFjdTzcysB7EBjQrSzJ1Pnogw0","image_bg_color":"333","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/openwisp","blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"Then send us an email with the following details:\n\n**1.

We use mesh networks.\n\nUmbrella Organisation\n-----\n\nWe act as umbrella organisation for other wireless communities like [Ninux](http://ninux.org), [qaul.net](http://qaul.net), [Guifi.net](http://guifi.net) or [WLAN Slovenija](https://wlan-si.net/) and communites developing software we extensivly use like [LEDE/OpenWRT](https://lede-project.org/), [OLSR](http://www.olsr.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page), [BATMAN](https://www.open-mesh.org/projects/open-mesh/wiki), [libremesh](http://libremesh.org/) or [retroshare](http://retroshare.sourceforge.net/).\n\nLocal communities provide software adapted to their own needs on their websites. There are more and more free wireless groups that meet regularly access in villages and cities.\n\nHardware and Software\n----\n\nMost devices in our networks are routers for home use. They should run with LEDE. In our local communities there are a lot of different approaches for different routing protocols, monitoring systems and map solutions. LEDE as OS for routers and OLSR, BATMAN and Babel as routing daemons are only a few examples of software developed together with freifunk.\nYou can find a great variety of topics where you can go on with wireless communities. We're looking for people working on new hardware drivers, improving routing protocols, developing network monitoring tools and user interface topics on the web interfaces, helping us with new features and tools to organize decentralized communities.\n\nCommon freifunk goals\n----\n\n* Educating and creating awareness on the subject of communication and freedom of information\n* Reducing the digital divide\n* Unhindered distribution of knowledge and resources\n* Empowering people to build and operate their own networks\n* Promote and support existing and new social structures\n\nAs we are decentralized there are some challenges, e.g. to get and show information about communities, working together with all those communties.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/Tu80Q6-06ZCb0Pe0dOXSDlu5rWIloTngJ-yFtxiWcWaMdulrE4QNZvgLfXwzeFWh7aXw_AeTulfhn-bY_FFnC8DH5vKghg","image_bg_color":"","gplus_url":"","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/freifunk","blog_url":"http://blog.freifunk.net","application_instructions":"First steps\n===\n\nPlease take a look on our [ideas page](https://wiki.freifunk.net/ideas) and select the idea you like.

The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator  http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments have announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: detector and accelerator simulation (Falcon, Geant4, GeantV, Pythia, SixTrack), data analysis (ROOT, TMVA, scikit-HEP, Go-HEP), event reconstruction (CMS Tracking), data management (transfer2go) and many others.

This year the program has expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator  http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments have announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: detector and accelerator simulation (Falcon, Geant4, GeantV, Pythia, SixTrack), data analysis (ROOT, TMVA, scikit-HEP, Go-HEP), event reconstruction (CMS Tracking), data management (transfer2go) and many others.

There are many individual R packages and other software that fit specific ecological models, but they lack flexibility in terms of the type of models and available Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms.  The second, perhaps equally important, is to showcase how NIMBLE can serve as a computational engine “under the hood” of an R package, and to develop extensions to NIMBLE that will support its use in this way.  The proposed package, called nimbleEcology, will provide a unified framework that allows users to model a variety of ecological process with a simple specification of the model structure, and estimate them using efficient and customizable MCMC samplers.","assignee_display_names":["Daniel Turek","Perry de Valpine"],"program_year":2017},{"id":5852466114461696,"title":"Nmap Scripting Engine—Script Developer (Vulnerability and exploitation specialist)","subcategory":"nse","organization":{"id":5824514215641088,"name":"Nmap Security Scanner","slug":"nmap-security-scanner","website_url":"https://nmap.org/","category":"security","contact_email":"fyodor@nmap.org","mailing_list":"http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/","irc_channel":"http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=nmap","tagline":"Swiss Army knife of network discovery and security auditing","precis":"Nmap (\"Network Mapper\") is a network discovery & security auditing tool that uses raw IP packets in novel ways to find hosts, operating systems, apps, open ports, and much more.","description":"Nmap (\"Network Mapper\") is a free and open source utility for network discovery and security auditing.

Users of _ns-3_ can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in _ns-3_ is the high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds.  Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.\n\nProject details\n===========\n_ns-3_ has been in development since 2006 and has made 26 releases (ns-3.26 in October 2016).  _ns-3_ models are written in C++, with Python bindings and Python-based build tools.  The tool is in wide use in the field; we provide statistics about the project on our [web site](https://www.nsnam.org/overview/statistics/), but in summary, the community includes over 7000 people subscribed to our users forum, 1500 people subscribed to our developers mailing list, 200 recognized code contributors, and about 12 active maintainers.  The project's impact on the field is high:  the number of annual academic publications citing use of _ns-3_ is an imprecise count but appears to range in the several hundreds per year based on our searching of IEEE and ACM digital libraries and Google Scholar.

Performing HTML parsing on a separate thread gives rise to the following performance gains:\n1. Web pages become more responsive, because the main thread becomes available to perform other functions, such as parsing CSS or handling input events.\n2. The parser thread can perform speculative parsing on the rest of the document while the main thread evaluates scripts. This ensures that the parser is not fully blocked while evaluating Javascript.","assignee_display_names":["Anthony Ramine"],"program_year":2017},{"id":5663325821075456,"title":"OMEMO encrypted Jingle implementation","subcategory":"smack","organization":{"id":6327289865306112,"name":"XMPP Standards Foundation","slug":"xmpp-standards-foundation","website_url":"https://xmpp.org","category":"social_communications","contact_email":null,"mailing_list":"https://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/gsoc","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"Secure messaging with open standards","precis":"The XSF is an umbrella organisation covering clients and servers using the Internet standard messaging protocol XMPP","description":"The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is an open technology for real-time communication, which powers a wide range of applications including instant messaging, presence, multi-party chat, voice and video calls, collaboration, lightweight middleware, content syndication, and generalized routing of XML data.\n\nThe XMPP Standards Foundation is responsible for most of the specifications for this protocol, and in GSoC mentors students working on a wide range of XMPP-related software including chat applications, Internet of Things, social networks, servers, clients and others.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/o3Lssk4FmOOMiMSLfNheuQzORQaoZvbxVfR03EpWWMs5OEmb8e-m6yPVw6augoWfGWiBh7WWdYn_CpPHABsMOSdge-pbTT4","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/xmpp","blog_url":"http://xmpp.org/blog.html","application_instructions":"Hi, thanks for your interest in participating in Google's Summer of Code with the XSF.\n\nYour application can be free-form, or can follow the following as headings, but please cover off the points below.
