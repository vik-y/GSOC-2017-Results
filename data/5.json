Its modularity allows users to populate the framework with their own algorithms, allowing to put the focus on the signal processing implementation without worrying about how to embed that algorithm in a whole GNSS receiver. It also makes possible fair performance benchmarks using real GNSS signals, and its open source license allows free downloading, use and code inspection.\n\nThe proposed software receiver targets multi-constellation/multi-frequency architectures, pursuing the goals of efficiency, modularity, interoperability, and flexibility demanded by user domains that require non-standard features, such as earth observers or geodesists, and allowing applications such as the observation of the ionosphere, GNSS reflectometry, signal quality monitoring, space weather, and high-accuracy positioning based on carrier-phase navigation techniques. In this project, we focus on signal processing, understood as the process between the ADC and the computation of code and phase observables, including the demodulation of the navigation message. We purposely omit data processing, understood as the computation of the navigation solution from the observables and the navigation message, since there are a number of well-established libraries and applications for that (also in the open source side, such as GPSTk or RTKLIB).","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/2y3d9rTodPuBtEFoBUxpqcxfzyoUvQX4a_QI1Lv_i3KGvgMNP_mhqH7_C9ODQaGTWAbfC__XFFbLb4KdPu4tRNDoS2rHoT0","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"If you are an eligible and interested student, read through the list and note the projects you are interested in.

A series of minimal modules are meant to be bundled with the game's standard distribution to offer a sort of vanilla game experience, with a focus on commonly used systems that are often fragmented and re-implemented many times over. All such modules are community owned and maintained, guaranteed to work with every release.\n\n## Extensibility\n\nAny content is wrapped in modules ranging from tiny frameworks supporting commonly needed utility to large gameplay templates commonly referred to as mod packs in the Minecraft world, that in turn can depend on dozens of the smaller pieces, maximizing reusability.\n\nCreating a new module is as easy as running a single gradlew command, having a community repository created on GitHub is another single request away, and fetching source for any such community module is yet another single command.

It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code,  find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines.\nAll controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\n\n## For Users\n\ncoala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool.\nBesides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.\n\n## For Developers\n\nYou can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind. That means: no big boilerplate, just write one small object with one routine, add the parameters you like and see how coala automates the organisation of settings, user interaction and execution parallelisation.\n\n## For Newcomers\n\ncoala offers a great newcomer experience with an in depth step by step guide for your first contribution, extensive documentation of the whole workflow and fast and easy communication over the gitter channel.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Affero GNU Public License","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/WbQZ28FFe1fjF8nl3n3s7WaIA47dnpDpTdFRba3Y9iW34XtHL2PQanntLbUdmADFI_rjGwb6xX6ABMqLQtthAgOJW71ZFsA","image_bg_color":"ffffff","gplus_url":"","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/coala_analyzer","blog_url":"https://blog.coala.io","application_instructions":"Please read our FAQ at http://projects.coala.io/#/faq carefully and get started with our newcomer tutorial at https://coala.io/newcomer as well as being active on https://coala.io/chat.","topic_tags":["code analysis"],"technology_tags":["python"],"proposal_tags":["vulture","rstcheck","jetbrains","coala","gitmate"],"ideas_list":"https://projects.coala.io/","contact_method":"http://coala.io/chat","program_year":2017},"student":{"id":5111011548856320,"display_name":"Yash Nisar","program_year":2017},"abstract":"The aim of the project is to ease the process of testing bears in coala by significantly improving the testing API to yield favorable, easy to understand results, add support for at least 9 additional useful linter bears, integrate the MarkdownBear with useful plugins, include remark-lint to report error messages and get the MarkdownBear to a bug free state, enhance documentation to include the newly written Linter bears.","assignee_display_names":["Mischa Krüger"],"program_year":2017},{"id":5331912125054976,"title":"Extend usage of optimized GPU libraries in Theano","subcategory":"theano","organization":{"id":5164886469378048,"name":"Python Software Foundation","slug":"python-software-foundation-2","website_url":"https://www.python.org","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"gsoc-general@python.org","mailing_list":"https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/gsoc-general","irc_channel":"http://python-gsoc.org/#contact","tagline":"Python is a programming language used by scientists & software developers alike.","precis":"Python is a popular high-level programming language used by scientists, developers, and many others who want to work more quickly and integrate systems more effectively.","description":"Python is a popular high-level programming language used by scientists, developers, and many others who want to work more quickly and integrate systems more effectively.

It generalizes variational inverence so that the problem is build with blocks. The first and essential block is Model itself. Second is Approximation, in some cases $log Q(D)$ is not really needed.

Its simulations are driven by designs written in the domain-specific Infobiotics Language (IBL), which contains data that is then sent to the Biocompiler to be built into a Biocompiler Model internal structure.  \nCurrently, IBW offers limited support for two standard biological languages, the functionality-based Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) and the design-based Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL), a common medium of exchange for synthetic devices. While SBML is made use of by the simulation aspect of IBW, the design-based SBOL is used by the Biocompiler as a format to write its compiled design into. This project aims to enhance the Biocompiler’s ability to export and import SBOL and SBML. If IBW’s capacity to work with these two biological modelling standards is improved, its accessibility to computational biologists around the world would increase dramatically.

Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (http://regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (http://pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy.

Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (http://regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (http://pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community.

It includes\n\n- an effective data handling and storage facility,\n- a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,\n- a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,\n- graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and\n- a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.\n\nThe term “environment” is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.\n\nR, like S, is designed around a true computer language, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time.

It is interlinked to many other datasets. The knowledge in DBpedia is exposed through a technology stack called *Linked Data*, which has been revolutionizing the way applications interact with the Web: with Linked Data technologies, all APIs are interconnected via standard Web protocols and languages.\n\n# The Web of data\nSuch *Web of data* provides useful knowledge that can complement the *Web of documents* in many ways. See, for instance, how bloggers tag their posts or assign them to categories in order to organize and interconnect their blog posts. This is a very simple way to connect unstructured text to a structure (hierarchy of tags). For more advanced examples, see how **BBC** has created the *World Cup 2010 website* by interconnecting textual content and facts from their knowledge base.\n\nOr, more recently, did you see that **IBM's Watson used DBpedia data to win the Jeopardy challenge**?\n\n# DBpedia Spotlight\n\n**DBpedia Spotlight** is an open source text annotation tool that connects text to Linked Data by marking names of things in text (we call that *spotting*) and selecting between multiple interpretations of these names (we call that *disambiguation*). For example, `Washington` can be interpreted in more than 50 ways including a state, a government or a person.

First is understanding the query presented by the user, second is fetching relevant information based on the query through DBpedia and finally tailoring the responses based on the standards of each platform and developing subsequent user interactions with the Chatbot.\n\nBased on my understanding, the process of understanding the query would be undertaken by one of the mentioned QA Systems (HAWK, QANARY, openQA). Based on the response from these systems we need to query the DBpedia dataset using SPARQL and present the data back to the user in a meaningful way. Ideally, both the presentation and interaction flow needs to be tailored for the individual social network.\n\nI would like to stress that although the primary medium of interaction is text, platforms such as Facebook insist that a proper mix between chat and interactive elements such as images, buttons etc would lead to better user engagement.

Users of _ns-3_ can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in _ns-3_ is the high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds.  Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.\n\nProject details\n===========\n_ns-3_ has been in development since 2006 and has made 26 releases (ns-3.26 in October 2016).  _ns-3_ models are written in C++, with Python bindings and Python-based build tools.

A generic mechanism will be implemented allowing fuzzers to obtain feedback on code-coverage. In the next step this output will be further processed in order to actually run a particular fuzzer (such as AFL), although there might not be sufficient time to commit this to the source tree.\n\nTo sum up, the overall steps to getting a fuzzer running are the following:\n1.

Gatekeeper is an open source defence against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. To protect server resources from an attack, it services requests based on priority: the higher its priority, the closer to the exit of the egress queue its placed. Additionally, it also limits the requests’ maximum link bandwidth occupancy to 5%. Such countermeasures are implemented through the priority queue data structure which holds all requests in a single priority queue dropping low-priority requests when resources are low. This functionality allows us to allocate as many resources as possible to high-priority requests while servicing low-priority requests only when resources are idle. The successful implementation of this project will essentially enable a regular Linux router to help isolate and protect legitimate traffic during DoS attacks by employing Gatekeeper’s priority queue as a kernel module, enabled by its userspace component in Linux's tc(8) utility.","assignee_display_names":["Cody Doucette","Sachin Paryani"],"program_year":2017},{"id":6206459137228800,"title":"Gene Visualisation in Mixed Reality with Microsoft HoloLens.","subcategory":"visualisation","organization":{"id":5462038034776064,"name":"Genes, Genomes and Variation","slug":"genes-genomes-and-variation","website_url":"http://www.ensembl.org","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"helpdesk@ensembl.org","mailing_list":"http://lists.ensembl.org/mailman/listinfo/dev","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"Genome databases and browsers","precis":"The Ensembl Genome Browsers store and display genome sequences and their annotation across >40,000 species.","description":"Ensembl was created alongside the publication of the first draft of the human genome, in 2001, to distribute this goldmine of information to scientists across the world. It quickly became and remains one of the most important reference databases in genomics, following the rapid development of the field. Its initial mission included finding all of the genes in the human genome. A year later, the mouse genome was published and we developed tools to directly compare genomes across species. Over the following decade, sequencing capacity increased exponentially (faster that Moore's Law in fact) and large surveys started examining more species and more individuals within each species. Our mission therefore expanded to store these datasets and statistics efficiently. Finally, in recent years, sequencing has been used to study the biochemical activity of the DNA molecule within the different tissues of an individual, prompting us to extend yet again our remit.\n\nAt the same time, Ensembl is an evolving software development project. Over 15 years, we moved from a central relational MySQL database with a Perl API and static web pages, to an array of storage technologies with a RESTful interface and an interactive front-end. We have dedicated portals for the large clades on the tree of life (known as Ensembl Genomes). Our annotations are produced through centuries of CPU time, coordinated by our powerful eHive analysis workflow manager.\n\nToday, we are a team of nearly 60 full time staff, housed at the European Bioinformatics Institute, and we collaborate with many external contributors around the world, in particular via our Github repositories where you can see us work day-to-day.

Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (http://regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (http://pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in dozens of developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and India.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/sVDHWw3LviXkpfFg0c7JL5ScXMi45mmZhrVxqaZIiwpgKR3rkb32_KaXocjw_bnoll_ePtotlYF99VjXufs9yiBxi6QGZxjQ","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/openmrs","blog_url":"http://openmrs.org/blog/","application_instructions":"Thanks for applying to OpenMRS for GSoC 2017!

People should be able to walk up to any smart device - a vending machine, a poster, a toy, a bus stop, a rental car - and not have to download an app first. Everything should be just a tap away.\n\nThe number of smart devices is going to explode, and the assumption that each new device will require its own application just isn’t realistic. We need a system that lets anyone interact with any device at any time. The Physical Web isn’t about replacing native apps: it’s about enabling interaction when native apps just aren’t practical.\n\nThe Physical Web Project is the Google Summer of Code proposal for university students interested in developing applications around that technology. The Physical Web Project, while making use of Physical Web software, does not develop the Physical Web code-base itself. Physical Web is an open standard that everyone can use. By creating a common web standard that any device can use to offer interaction, a new range of services becomes possible. Instead, the Physical Web Project works on extending the Physical Web system with open source software enabling open source applications.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/5iSCmtWMuF8ChlKbH5urNkcXh3X-Gajm65_dIg8EshD85otOAVt23UvgPztwXiT6iwA3v1H3mIOfYm_RGARCjxaoqOio2KU","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"If you want to make a proposal as student, point your browser to the main GSoC 2017 site and follow the instructions there to register as student.

Every user in the free wireless network provides his or her wireless LAN router for data transfer to other participants. In return, he or she can also transmit data, such as text, music and movies through a free internal network or use services setup by participants to chat, call or play online games.

There are more and more free wireless groups that meet regularly access in villages and cities.\n\nHardware and Software\n----\n\nMost devices in our networks are routers for home use. They should run with LEDE. In our local communities there are a lot of different approaches for different routing protocols, monitoring systems and map solutions. LEDE as OS for routers and OLSR, BATMAN and Babel as routing daemons are only a few examples of software developed together with freifunk.\nYou can find a great variety of topics where you can go on with wireless communities. We're looking for people working on new hardware drivers, improving routing protocols, developing network monitoring tools and user interface topics on the web interfaces, helping us with new features and tools to organize decentralized communities.\n\nCommon freifunk goals\n----\n\n* Educating and creating awareness on the subject of communication and freedom of information\n* Reducing the digital divide\n* Unhindered distribution of knowledge and resources\n* Empowering people to build and operate their own networks\n* Promote and support existing and new social structures\n\nAs we are decentralized there are some challenges, e.g. to get and show information about communities, working together with all those communties.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/Tu80Q6-06ZCb0Pe0dOXSDlu5rWIloTngJ-yFtxiWcWaMdulrE4QNZvgLfXwzeFWh7aXw_AeTulfhn-bY_FFnC8DH5vKghg","image_bg_color":"","gplus_url":"","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/freifunk","blog_url":"http://blog.freifunk.net","application_instructions":"First steps\n===\n\nPlease take a look on our [ideas page](https://wiki.freifunk.net/ideas) and select the idea you like.

Ideally, upstream component developers begin the process by supplying SPDX flies as part of their downloads. Users of those components therefore have a starting point for the SPDX files they create for their \"customers,\" and so on. If everything is working properly, the provenance of each piece of code is researched and documented only once during its journey through a supply chain, and that information is passed on in parallel with the code in the SPDX format.\n\nExecution\n\nDevelopment of SPDX is run somewhat like an open source project: Those that participate influence. Decisions tend to be made by consensus. The spec itself is writen by a technical team with input and support from business and legal teams. Although much of the the initial focus was on Linux and the project is under the auspices of the Linux Foundation, the strategy from the outset has been much broader to be applicable to anything open source. To accommodate a range of needs, SPDX can be implemented in XML or tag-value formats.\n\nThe SPDX \"IP\" is all housed on this site. Most of that is embodied in the spec itself, but we have developed a number of separate assets that complement the specification, including a standard license list, implementation guidelines and the SPDX compatible tools.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/KPUFrolOBwRoenv7m-JwoqzokPodPn_Syqb5MRd15j89NIeaKEsP2g4mO9ZHX0dyAGdo-nf-rSiCgBjFZq-77KGnVFjih48","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"Please review the requirements described in the project ideas page at http://wiki.spdx.org/view/GSOC/GSOC_ProjectIdeas.

R is often the tool of choice for research in statistical methodology.","description":"R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. It includes\n\n- an effective data handling and storage facility,\n- a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,\n- a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,\n- graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and\n- a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.\n\nThe term “environment” is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.\n\nR, like S, is designed around a true computer language, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time.

It's also a great choice for creating integrated digital frameworks. You can extend it with any one, or many, of thousands of add-ons. Modules expand Drupal's functionality. Themes let you customize your content's presentation. Distributions are packaged Drupal bundles you can use as starter-kits. Mix and match these components to enhance Drupal's core abilities. Or, integrate Drupal with external services and other applications in your infrastructure. No other content management software is this powerful and scalable. The Drupal project is open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. It's distributed under the terms of the GNU (GPL). There are no licensing fees, ever. Drupal will always be free. The Drupal community is one of the largest open source communities in the world. We're more than 1,000,000 passionate developers, designers, trainers, strategists, coordinators, editors, and sponsors working together. We build Drupal, provide support, create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit pushes the Drupal project forward. New members are always welcome. Drupal 8 is the biggest update in Drupal's history. Creating content is easier. Every built-in theme is responsively designed.

Boost.Geometry used Vincenty formula, the time complexity of this algorithm is hard to estimate and expensive.\n\nTo reduce the time complexity, this project tried to use the following approaches:\n* **Condition Division**:Compute the Euclidean distances first, if the length of two segments are very close, defined not “far enough” means “very close”. then fall back to expensive geographic distance calculation otherwise return the result by comparing those numbers obtained by less expensive cartesian computation.\n* **Calculation with Sectorial Area**:Get cross-section through the center of ellipsoid and the geodesic segments, then calculate the sectorial area, which is easy to compare distances. \n* **Calculation with Performing a local spheroid approximation and return the 2D distance by map projection**:Perform a local spheroid approximation, then use methods of map projection to calculate the distances.","assignee_display_names":["Vissarion Fysikopoulos"],"program_year":2017},{"id":5480818104336384,"title":"GSOC: Migrate Plinth to Fedora Server","subcategory":"development:python","organization":{"id":5622162267308032,"name":"Fedora Project","slug":"fedora-project","website_url":"https://getfedora.org/","category":"operating_systems","contact_email":"summer-coding@lists.fedoraproject.org","mailing_list":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/admin/lists/summer-coding@lists.fedoraproject.org","irc_channel":"https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#fedora-summer-coding","tagline":"Fedora Linux is built on the foundations of Freedom, Friends, Features, & First","precis":"Advance Free/Open Source Software/Content.

The first one is modifying the source code module by module to convert it to RPM-based, including replacing the apt command code with the dnf command code or fit both of them, changing the Deb-based packages into RPM-based packages which play the same roles and testing after each module finished. The second part is a little scattered, including making a RPM package for Plinth and setting up a repo for it in [Copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/), testing inside a Virtual Machine, and modifying some configuration files and the documents for users to fit the changes of Plinth during this project, at the same time, a new wiki page for Plinth in Fedora is needed.","assignee_display_names":["Tong Hui"],"program_year":2017}]}
