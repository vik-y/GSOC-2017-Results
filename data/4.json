As a result, there is a lag when images larger than 700KB are handled. Also, Image Sequencer works only for browsers currently as it uses a browser dependancy (the class Image).\n\n### Aim of my project\nThe aim of my Project is to expand the module library by implementing powerful processing modules (As listed at the end of this proposal) followed by integration with GPU.js for enabling GPU-backed calculations and hence enhance performance, reliability and speed. And, ultimately, to develop Image Sequencer as an importable library for image manipulation. Also, support will be developed for JSON input. Node support (non browser) will be added.

But if you have a wacky idea, we might still be interested if we can turn it into something achievable in 3 months.\r\n- Be appropriate: Demonstrate you have a knowledge of Apertium, how it works and the problem it has that you'd like to solve.\r\n- Have a plan: Three months may seem like a long time, but it isn't. Provide a weekly plan with dates and deliverables. Leave time for getting familiar with the platform — ideally before, or in the community bonding period — and for documentation. If you plan to work on a language pair, make yourself familiar with testvoc and other quality controls, and factor those in. If you know of any breaks or absences beforehand, mention them and plan around them.\r\n- Get in contact ASAP!: We get lots of proposals: only a few are good. Contact your potential mentor as soon as possible: send your proposal to the mailing list, hang out on IRC, ask for feedback, and refine your application based on feedback. If you are remembered, you are more likely to be picked.\r\n- Read the Ideas Page!

Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (http://regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (http://pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in dozens of developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and India.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/sVDHWw3LviXkpfFg0c7JL5ScXMi45mmZhrVxqaZIiwpgKR3rkb32_KaXocjw_bnoll_ePtotlYF99VjXufs9yiBxi6QGZxjQ","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/openmrs","blog_url":"http://openmrs.org/blog/","application_instructions":"Thanks for applying to OpenMRS for GSoC 2017!

But if you have a wacky idea, we might still be interested if we can turn it into something achievable in 3 months.\r\n- Be appropriate: Demonstrate you have a knowledge of Apertium, how it works and the problem it has that you'd like to solve.\r\n- Have a plan: Three months may seem like a long time, but it isn't. Provide a weekly plan with dates and deliverables. Leave time for getting familiar with the platform — ideally before, or in the community bonding period — and for documentation. If you plan to work on a language pair, make yourself familiar with testvoc and other quality controls, and factor those in. If you know of any breaks or absences beforehand, mention them and plan around them.\r\n- Get in contact ASAP!: We get lots of proposals: only a few are good. Contact your potential mentor as soon as possible: send your proposal to the mailing list, hang out on IRC, ask for feedback, and refine your application based on feedback. If you are remembered, you are more likely to be picked.\r\n- Read the Ideas Page!

While we develop several software products, the library which is most heavily developed and core to our team is HPX. \n\nHPX (High Performance ParalleX) is a general purpose C++ runtime system for parallel and distributed applications of any scale. It strives to provide a unified programming model which transparently utilizes the available resources to achieve unprecedented levels of scalability.  This library strictly adheres to the C++11 Standard and leverages the Boost C++ Libraries which makes HPX easy to use, highly optimized, and very portable.  HPX is developed for conventional architectures including Linux-based systems, Windows, Mac, and the BlueGene/Q, as well as accelerators such as the Xeon Phi.\n\nWe envision HPX as a library which provides services to applications which makes writing efficient, maintainable, and scalable parallel and distributed codes much simpler than current popular paradigms.

Chapel is implemented with portability in mind, permitting Chapel to run on multicore desktops and laptops, commodity clusters, and the cloud, in addition to the high-end supercomputers for which it was designed. Chapel's design and development are being led by Cray Inc. in collaboration with academia, computing centers, and industry. Chapel offers a unique experience for students to work on projects involving high-performance computing, parallel programming, and compiler development.\n\n# Core features\n\n**Native Parallelism**\n\nChapel supports parallelism at the language level. For instance, Chapel provides a \"coforall\" loop, which is similar to a \"for\" loop and creates a separate task per iteration of the loop body. These explicit parallelism features make it easier to reason about the parallelism in your algorithm and program.\n\n**Data and Task Locality**\n\nWhen working on a large machine, the location of some data relative to the task which uses it or other data with which it must work plays a key role in performance. Chapel provides features which allow you to control that placement, both within a data structure and outside it.\n\n**Multiresolution Philosophy**\n\nChapel is designed around a multiresolution philosophy, permitting users to initially write very abstract code and then incrementally add more detail until they are as close to the machine as their needs require.\n\n**Modern Language Features**\n\nChapel supports code reuse and rapid prototyping via object-oriented design, type inference, and features for generic programming.\n\n**Interoperability**\n\nExisting code from other languages can be integrated into Chapel programs (or vice-versa) via interoperability features.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ouhiO9cOmNc2otF9_uh-s1fRB4kbfn9-x9gjGtLmY2DccpHt3zWa1gUS17PrDZzpm0L1djadVeO9yOZ2501T2udHmY0LsF4","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/chapellanguage","blog_url":"https://www.facebook.com/ChapelLanguage","application_instructions":"Please see: http://chapel.cray.com/gsoc/apply.html","topic_tags":["programming languages","compilers","high performance computing","distributed computing","parallel computing"],"technology_tags":["chapel","python","high performance computing","c","c++"],"proposal_tags":["libraries and applications","compatibility","compiler","runtime","infrastructure","other"],"ideas_list":"http://chapel.cray.com/gsoc/ideas.html","contact_method":"chapel_info@cray.com","program_year":2017},"student":{"id":5575933168713728,"display_name":"LouisJenkinsCS","program_year":2017},"abstract":"Built-in data structures are a necessity for any budding language, and in a language where distributed computing is at its core, data structures that can properly be maintained across clusters is desired.\n\nWith the help of Engin Kayraklioglu, we plan to implement a Distributed Queue as a proof-of-concept data structure which may pave the way to other, more interesting data structures such as lists, trees, and graphs.","assignee_display_names":["Michael Ferguson","Engin Kayraklioglu"],"program_year":2017},{"id":5737238322216960,"title":"Distributed Workload Management","subcategory":"from ideas list","organization":{"id":5416945173135360,"name":"Apache Software Foundation","slug":"apache-software-foundation","website_url":"http://www.apache.org","category":"other","contact_email":"dev@community.apache.org","mailing_list":"http://apache.org/foundation/mailinglists.html","irc_channel":"https://wiki.apache.org/general/IRC","tagline":"Providing open source software to the public free of charge","precis":"Founded in 1999, the Apache Software Foundation is home to over 180 projects and countless contributors","description":"The Apache Software Foundation provides organizational, legal, and financial support for a broad range of open source software projects.

Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nMany users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/e6UifH3TR9p8a-8sKngoEkMHw_0yJ1ssFPNN1WH-gkUOHdRwf_qU-O5UVhN3co1AZzrI7atjqYKTtl6p-z6sKq65rRanTg","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":"http://www.r-bloggers.com/","application_instructions":"1. look for a project on\nhttps://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2017/wiki/table-of-proposed-coding-projects\n\n2.

The main objective of the project, called **ProvinciaWiFi** (later renamed [WiFi Metropolitano](http://www.cittametropolitanaroma.gov.it/index.php/wifimetropolitano-english-version)), was to take a decisive step to reduce the existing **digital divide** by fostering and facilitating the use of ICT by citizens.\nFrom the outset it was decided to commit the project to a completely open philosophy. For this reason a clear choice towards open software and operating systems and the availability of every modification, update and improvement to the community was made. The same approach was adopted for the knowledge and the experience acquired within the project. In order to pursue this goals the Province of Rome called the university consortium *CASPUR* (later merged in the [CINECA](https://www.cineca.it/en) consortium) to develop the technical solution. In this context, a research project conducted by the *CINECA* consortium found its perfect application. This project proposed an innovative methodology for the distribution of networks (more precisely Virtual LANs used for Wi-Fi connectivity) between geographically distant sites. \n\nThe methodology adopted made it possible to host public connectivity services on non-dedicated network infrastructures (e.g.: private xDSL) that for technical and legal reasons could not be used as such. \u2028This is not the sole advantage that OpenWISP gave to *WiFi Metropolitano*: embracing the resource-sharing philosophy – typical of open projects – anyone can contribute to the network expansion simply by hosting an access point.\n\n\u2028The software tools and the architectures, including the OpenWISP 2 [wifi controller](http://openwisp.org/whatis.html#wifi-controller) and different [NetJSON](http://netjson.org/) implementations used in OpenWISP,  are released to the public free of charge under open-source licenses, we hope this will allow a broader audience to benefit from this work and improve upon it.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/pNekwasncafkQ2pz4_5TwyxaZHDyy1AU6rHJ-FFGNzL0Fag6orGBoWECJmHQ_wxWkAb0GhFjdTzcysB7EBjQrSzJ1Pnogw0","image_bg_color":"333","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/openwisp","blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"Then send us an email with the following details:\n\n**1.

It allows users to analyse projects containing multiple languages with just one tool, using just one configuration and seeing just one user interface.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nWith coala, you create just one configuration file. It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code,  find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines.\nAll controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\n\n## For Users\n\ncoala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool.\nBesides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.\n\n## For Developers\n\nYou can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind. That means: no big boilerplate, just write one small object with one routine, add the parameters you like and see how coala automates the organisation of settings, user interaction and execution parallelisation.\n\n## For Newcomers\n\ncoala offers a great newcomer experience with an in depth step by step guide for your first contribution, extensive documentation of the whole workflow and fast and easy communication over the gitter channel.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Affero GNU Public License","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/WbQZ28FFe1fjF8nl3n3s7WaIA47dnpDpTdFRba3Y9iW34XtHL2PQanntLbUdmADFI_rjGwb6xX6ABMqLQtthAgOJW71ZFsA","image_bg_color":"ffffff","gplus_url":"","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/coala_analyzer","blog_url":"https://blog.coala.io","application_instructions":"Please read our FAQ at http://projects.coala.io/#/faq carefully and get started with our newcomer tutorial at https://coala.io/newcomer as well as being active on https://coala.io/chat.","topic_tags":["code analysis"],"technology_tags":["python"],"proposal_tags":["vulture","rstcheck","jetbrains","coala","gitmate"],"ideas_list":"https://projects.coala.io/","contact_method":"http://coala.io/chat","program_year":2017},"student":{"id":5756970200989696,"display_name":"Saurav Singh","program_year":2017},"abstract":"To develop an analyzing routine at least for python and java that will find all documentation strings in a file, parse them into specific groups and check them against a specified documentation style given by the user.

[FLASH](http://flash.uchicago.edu/site/flashcode/)). The analysis of such data helps multiple types of research from being able to forecast a solar storms to detect planets in other stars, from understanding how galaxies are formed to explain the expansion and the origin of the universe.\n\nOpen Astronomy currently is formed by [eight organisations](http://openastronomy.org/members/) that develop tools for different aspects on astronomy. The range of topics covered by these projects is wide, for example: \n- [Astropy](http://astropy.org) is a general Python library for astronomy, providing common tools such as celestial coordinates, image processing, tabular data  reading and writing, units and support for astronomy-specific file formats; \n- [SunPy](http://sunpy.org) provides utilities for obtaining and representing solar physics data, with clients for some of the largest online solar physics data archives and solar specific analysis and visualisation code; \n- [Glue](http://www.glueviz.org/) is a data visualization application and library to explore relationships within and among related datasets;\n- ChiantiPy is a Python interface to the CHIANTI atomic database, which allows users to characterise the properties (temperature, density, velocity) of observed stars from spectra; \n- [Julia Astro](http://juliaastro.github.io/) is a set of packages for general astronomy and astrophysics analysis using Julia. \n- And more!\n\nAs a single organisation, we aim to strengthen collaborations between the different sub-organisations, and at the same time increase the awareness among our users on the capabilities of our \"sister\" projects.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 3-Clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License (BSD-3-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/NfYKDdBunfpzSJmItKXoW2SuvQ2uJ22VG53qStOGeGhFmsxiph5RcylIST7KAHc9GWS0RJnWTPX_C6eNWORsWptkh5juOQ","image_bg_color":"FFFFFF","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/Open_Astronomy","blog_url":"http://openastronomy.org/blog.html","application_instructions":"Do you want to participate in OpenAstronomy as part of the GSoC?

The Foundation’s mission is to promote software literacy within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology-related fields — and to make these fields accessible to diverse communities. Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.\n\nWe do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes [Processing (Java)](http://processing.org), [p5.js (JavaScript)](http://p5js.org), and [Processing.py (Python)](http://py.processing.org/), and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.\n\nThe Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or ability. We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.\n\nAt our core is the philosophy and politics of open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skillset, but is instead a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. We believe software literacy and an understanding of media of all kinds is essential knowledge for today.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU Library or \"Lesser\" General Public License version 2.1 (LGPL-2.1)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/2Wa4Zi7TvMnCYAF9_ijUWrAa6VM2GvfPIdCffm7nsun-9O7nUPF-RsvBty_hFhrv4KcULNyhat_t_1pJiHxu7JhHLVlTWTs","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/processingorg","blog_url":"https://medium.com/@processingorg","application_instructions":"Thanks for your interest in the Processing Foundation!

The first thing you should do is read over the [Project List wiki page on github](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Project-List). There you'll find links to all of the relevant github repositories as well as lists of topics and projects for which we are actively seeking help. If you have questions about an idea or need guidance on forming your proposal, please post to the [Processing Forum](https://forum.processing.org/two/categories/summer-of-code-2017). \n\nFor GSoC, we actively seek help with features we know we need, but also look to applicants to propose ideas we haven't thought of ourselves. If you have an idea for a new feature for any of our environments, it's generally preferable to propose it as a library or mode so that it can be developed and tested as a standalone project. For all of our projects, it's incredibly important that things are kept as simple and user-friendly as possible. Our work is not for developers. It's for people who are less familiar with code, and/or just want to get things done. We're far less interested in features to make the environments more powerful for advanced users than we are in features that make it easier to handle tasks that are common for a wide range of our audience. \n\nYou should feel free to propose your idea however you see fit.

The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator  http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe.

Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments have announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: detector and accelerator simulation (Falcon, Geant4, GeantV, Pythia, SixTrack), data analysis (ROOT, TMVA, scikit-HEP, Go-HEP), event reconstruction (CMS Tracking), data management (transfer2go) and many others.

Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nMany users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/e6UifH3TR9p8a-8sKngoEkMHw_0yJ1ssFPNN1WH-gkUOHdRwf_qU-O5UVhN3co1AZzrI7atjqYKTtl6p-z6sKq65rRanTg","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":"http://www.r-bloggers.com/","application_instructions":"1. look for a project on\nhttps://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2017/wiki/table-of-proposed-coding-projects\n\n2.

This year the program has expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator  http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments have announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: detector and accelerator simulation (Falcon, Geant4, GeantV, Pythia, SixTrack), data analysis (ROOT, TMVA, scikit-HEP, Go-HEP), event reconstruction (CMS Tracking), data management (transfer2go) and many others.

PostgreSQL uses a double-linked list in the shared memory to record all conflicts of each transaction. Based on the list structure, the rw-conflict tracking has a time complexity of O(N^2). The designer assumed that the list is short so that the overhead can be ignored. However, some benchmarks reported that the conflict-tracking took up to half the CPU time at high concurrency levels, where searching the list becomes a bottleneck. There are five static functions existing in the project to manage the rw-conflicts. We intend to rewrite these functions by replacing linked list with other data structures to support faster search. There are two possible replacements. Hash table is the first choice because there is an existing implementation of hash table (HTAB) in shared memory in PostgreSQL. Skip list is the other choice as it is similar to the linked list.","assignee_display_names":["alvherre","Kevin Grittner"],"program_year":2017},{"id":4964906492231680,"title":"Elm for iOS and Android","subcategory":"compiler","organization":{"id":6174333933191168,"name":"Elm Software Foundation","slug":"elm-software-foundation","website_url":"http://elm-lang.org/","category":"languages","contact_email":"info@elm-lang.org","mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/elm-discuss","irc_channel":"http://elmlang.herokuapp.com/","tagline":"A delightful functional language for reliable webapps.","precis":"Elm is a functional language that compiles to JavaScript, competing with projects like React.

It quickly became and remains one of the most important reference databases in genomics, following the rapid development of the field. Its initial mission included finding all of the genes in the human genome. A year later, the mouse genome was published and we developed tools to directly compare genomes across species. Over the following decade, sequencing capacity increased exponentially (faster that Moore's Law in fact) and large surveys started examining more species and more individuals within each species. Our mission therefore expanded to store these datasets and statistics efficiently. Finally, in recent years, sequencing has been used to study the biochemical activity of the DNA molecule within the different tissues of an individual, prompting us to extend yet again our remit.\n\nAt the same time, Ensembl is an evolving software development project. Over 15 years, we moved from a central relational MySQL database with a Perl API and static web pages, to an array of storage technologies with a RESTful interface and an interactive front-end. We have dedicated portals for the large clades on the tree of life (known as Ensembl Genomes). Our annotations are produced through centuries of CPU time, coordinated by our powerful eHive analysis workflow manager.\n\nToday, we are a team of nearly 60 full time staff, housed at the European Bioinformatics Institute, and we collaborate with many external contributors around the world, in particular via our Github repositories where you can see us work day-to-day.

Users of _ns-3_ can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in _ns-3_ is the high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds.  Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.\n\nProject details\n===========\n_ns-3_ has been in development since 2006 and has made 26 releases (ns-3.26 in October 2016).  _ns-3_ models are written in C++, with Python bindings and Python-based build tools.

Encrypting communications between the client and the server using SSL is not enough to protect users privacy, since data can be read in plaintext in the server, which can not be trustworthy.\n\nIt is trickier to perform E2EE into SwellRT documents than it is to perform it into simple chat messages. SwellRT use operational transformations (OTs) to coordinate the insertion and deletion of characters in its documents, so instead of encrypting the entire document, we need to encrypt each operation and still guarantee that the server know enough information to coordinate the document editioning. Fortunately, it is a field that has been researched for many years and we have some studies that have successfully implemented E2EE in Google Docs. We can take their insights to encrypt SwellRT OTs.\n\nThe project has two parts. First, we need to encrypt and decrypt successfully SwellRT OTs, using a symmetric key. Then, we need to communicate those symmetric keys among users, and here is where we need public key cryptography.","assignee_display_names":["Pablo Ojanguren","Samer Hassan"],"program_year":2017},{"id":4814816785989632,"title":"Enforcing type safety in Dottydoc code examples","subcategory":"compilers","organization":{"id":4568241046290432,"name":"Scala","slug":"scala","website_url":"http://www.scala-lang.org","category":"languages","contact_email":"julien.richard-foy@epfl.ch","mailing_list":"https://users.scala-lang.org/","irc_channel":"https://gitter.im/scala/scala","tagline":"The programming language where object-oriented meets functional.","precis":"Scala is a hybrid object-oriented and functional programming language that runs on the JVM and JavaScript.","description":"# A Scalable language\nScala is an acronym for “Scalable Language”. This means that Scala grows with you. At the root, the language’s scalability is the result of a careful integration of object-oriented and functional language concepts.\n\nScala is the preferred workhorse language for many mission critical server systems. The generated code is on a par with Java’s and its precise typing means that many problems are caught at compile-time rather than after deployment.\n\n# Object-Oriented\nScala is a pure-bred object-oriented language. Conceptually, every value is an object and every operation is a method-call. The language supports advanced component architectures through classes and traits.\n\n# Functional\nEven though its syntax is fairly conventional, Scala is also a full-blown functional language. It has everything you would expect, including first-class functions, a library with efficient immutable data structures, and a general preference of immutability over mutation.\n\n# Seamless Java Interop\nScala runs on the JVM. Java and Scala classes can be freely mixed, no matter whether they reside in different projects or in the same. They can even mutually refer to each other, the Scala compiler contains a subset of a Java compiler to make sense of such recursive dependencies.\n\n# Fun\nMaybe most important is that programming in Scala tends to be very enjoyable. No boilerplate, rapid iteration, but at the same time the safety of a strong static type system.

It allows users to analyse projects containing multiple languages with just one tool, using just one configuration and seeing just one user interface.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nWith coala, you create just one configuration file. It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code,  find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines.\nAll controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\n\n## For Users\n\ncoala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool.\nBesides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.\n\n## For Developers\n\nYou can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind. That means: no big boilerplate, just write one small object with one routine, add the parameters you like and see how coala automates the organisation of settings, user interaction and execution parallelisation.\n\n## For Newcomers\n\ncoala offers a great newcomer experience with an in depth step by step guide for your first contribution, extensive documentation of the whole workflow and fast and easy communication over the gitter channel.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Affero GNU Public License","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/WbQZ28FFe1fjF8nl3n3s7WaIA47dnpDpTdFRba3Y9iW34XtHL2PQanntLbUdmADFI_rjGwb6xX6ABMqLQtthAgOJW71ZFsA","image_bg_color":"ffffff","gplus_url":"","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/coala_analyzer","blog_url":"https://blog.coala.io","application_instructions":"Please read our FAQ at http://projects.coala.io/#/faq carefully and get started with our newcomer tutorial at https://coala.io/newcomer as well as being active on https://coala.io/chat.","topic_tags":["code analysis"],"technology_tags":["python"],"proposal_tags":["vulture","rstcheck","jetbrains","coala","gitmate"],"ideas_list":"https://projects.coala.io/","contact_method":"http://coala.io/chat","program_year":2017},"student":{"id":4937009941446656,"display_name":"Satwik Kansal","program_year":2017},"abstract":"coala is a modular and language-agnostic tool for performing static code analysis.

It is a unique opportunity to share the latest innovations in open source technologies and meet contributors and potential partners. Past FOSSASIA events have attracted thousands of participants, speakers from 35 countries, and hundreds of volunteers.\nIn today’s techno-friendly world all attendees coming to the conference have some kind of device which may have IOS, Windows or Android support. The device helps them to stay updated with the outer world. The Open Event Android project consists of two components. The App Generator is a web application that is hosted on a server and generates an event Android app from a zip with JSON and binary files (examples here) or through an API. The second component of the project is the Open Event app - the output of the app generator which helps the attendees to get better knowledge about the events, speakers, sessions, sponsors of the event beforehand. \nI would like to propose enhancement in the android app and android app generator web app of the Open Event.","assignee_display_names":["NiranjanRajendran","championswimmer","Elio Qoshi","Nayana Adassuriya","Harshit D (the-dagger)","Manan Wason","Eden Dang","Victoria Bondarchuk"],"program_year":2017},{"id":6403590009651200,"title":"Enhancement of the pt_assistant plugin","subcategory":"josm","organization":{"id":5161142197420032,"name":"OpenStreetMap","slug":"openstreetmap","website_url":"http://www.openstreetmap.org/","category":"data_and_databases","contact_email":null,"mailing_list":"https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mailing_lists","irc_channel":"http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/IRC","tagline":"OpenStreetMap - Creating and distributing free geographic data for the world.","precis":"At OpenStreetMap, volunteer surveyors gather map data of the whole world, laying the foundations for many awesome apps built on top.","description":"OpenStreetMap is a project that creates and distributes free geographic data for the world.

Our tools give a proof, but are easy to use.","description":"We are a group of developers who are passionate about code quality.\nWe have built an innovative lightweight verification tool called the\n[Checker Framework](https://checkerframework.org/).\n\nThe Checker Framework helps you prevent bugs at development time,\nbefore they escape to production.  It is based on the idea of\n_pluggable type-checking_.  Pluggable type-checking replaces a\nprogramming language's built-in type system with a more powerful,\nexpressive one.\n\nJava's type system prevents some bugs, such as `int count =\n\"hello\";`.  However, it does not prevent other bugs, such as null\npointer dereferences, concurrency errors, disclosure of private\ninformation, incorrect internationalization, out-of-bounds indices, and\nso forth.\n\nThe Checker Framework enables you to create a more powerful type\nsystem and use it in place of Java's.  The more powerful type system\nis not just a bug-finding tool:  it is a verification tool that gives\na guarantee that no errors (of certain types) exist in your program.\nEven though it is powerful, it is easy to use.  It follows the\nstandard typing rules that programmers already know, and it fits into\ntheir workflow.  We have created around 20 [new type\nsystems](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#introduction), and other\npeople have created [many\nmore](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#third-party-checkers).\n\nThe Checker Framework is popular:  it is successfully used on hundreds\nof projects at Google, on Wall Street, and in other companies from big\nto small.  It it attractive to programmers who care about their craft\nand the quality of their code.  The Checker Framework is the\nmotivation for Java's type annotations feature.  Talks on it have\nreceived multiple awards at conferences such as JavaOne.  With this\nwidespread use, there is a need for people to help with the project:\neverything from bug fixes, to new features, to case studies, to IDE\nintegration.

Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time.

High-density clusters are defined on a population with density _f_ in _r_ dimensions to be the maximal connected sets of form _{ x : f(x) >= lambda }_, for any _lambda > 0_. Varying this density level lambda across all possible density thresholds forms a hierarchy of density level sets known as the cluster tree.\n\nIn 1981, the consistency of different linkage criteria in the context of the cluster tree was studied by Hartigan, and the notion of fractional consistency (also called Hartigan consistency) was introduced. In the same seminal paper, single-linkage was proven by Hartigan to be inconsistent for dimensions _r >= 2_. It was not until 2010 that the first provably consistent algorithm for estimating the cluster tree in more than one dimension was proven. These results have undoubtedly played a large role in rekindling a number of recent research efforts related to the cluster tree.","assignee_display_names":["Mikhail Belkin","Michael Hahsler"],"program_year":2017},{"id":6193527393353728,"title":"ETE/Tree matcher","subcategory":"","organization":{"id":5447537956749312,"name":"Open Bioinformatics Foundation","slug":"open-bioinformatics-foundation","website_url":"https://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Main_Page","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"gsoc@mailman.open-bio.org","mailing_list":"http://obf.github.io/GSoC/contact/","irc_channel":"http://obf.github.io/GSoC/contact/","tagline":"Promoting practice & philosophy of OSS & Open Science in biological research.","precis":"Promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software development and Open Science within the biological research community.","description":"The Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF) is a non-profit, volunteer-run group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software development and Open Science within the biological research community.\n\nOur main activities are:\n\n* Running and supporting the BOSC conferences.\n* Organizing and supporting developer-centric \"Hackathon\" events.\n* Participating in the Google Summer of Code program on behalf of our member projects as an umbrella mentoring organization.\n* Managing servers, colocation facilities, bank account, domain names, and other assets for the benefit of our member projects.\n* Public opinion and policy statements about matters related to Open Source and Open Science in bioinformatics.\n\nThe Foundation does not participate directly in the development or structure of the open source work, but as the members of the foundation are drawn from our projects' developer communities, there is clear commonality of direction and purpose.\n\nThe OBF is governed by a Board of Directors.

Although it is possible to trace this kind of problems using Erlang tracing or dedicated profilers it can be difficult and time-consuming.\n\nThe plugin I would like to deliver will rely on tracing techniques and the Erlang system introspection API.
