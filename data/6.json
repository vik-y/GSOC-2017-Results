Every user in the free wireless network provides his or her wireless LAN router for data transfer to other participants. In return, he or she can also transmit data, such as text, music and movies through a free internal network or use services setup by participants to chat, call or play online games. We use mesh networks.\n\nUmbrella Organisation\n-----\n\nWe act as umbrella organisation for other wireless communities like [Ninux](http://ninux.org), [qaul.net](http://qaul.net), [Guifi.net](http://guifi.net) or [WLAN Slovenija](https://wlan-si.net/) and communites developing software we extensivly use like [LEDE/OpenWRT](https://lede-project.org/), [OLSR](http://www.olsr.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page), [BATMAN](https://www.open-mesh.org/projects/open-mesh/wiki), [libremesh](http://libremesh.org/) or [retroshare](http://retroshare.sourceforge.net/).\n\nLocal communities provide software adapted to their own needs on their websites. There are more and more free wireless groups that meet regularly access in villages and cities.\n\nHardware and Software\n----\n\nMost devices in our networks are routers for home use. They should run with LEDE. In our local communities there are a lot of different approaches for different routing protocols, monitoring systems and map solutions. LEDE as OS for routers and OLSR, BATMAN and Babel as routing daemons are only a few examples of software developed together with freifunk.\nYou can find a great variety of topics where you can go on with wireless communities. We're looking for people working on new hardware drivers, improving routing protocols, developing network monitoring tools and user interface topics on the web interfaces, helping us with new features and tools to organize decentralized communities.\n\nCommon freifunk goals\n----\n\n* Educating and creating awareness on the subject of communication and freedom of information\n* Reducing the digital divide\n* Unhindered distribution of knowledge and resources\n* Empowering people to build and operate their own networks\n* Promote and support existing and new social structures\n\nAs we are decentralized there are some challenges, e.g. to get and show information about communities, working together with all those communties.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/Tu80Q6-06ZCb0Pe0dOXSDlu5rWIloTngJ-yFtxiWcWaMdulrE4QNZvgLfXwzeFWh7aXw_AeTulfhn-bY_FFnC8DH5vKghg","image_bg_color":"","gplus_url":"","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/freifunk","blog_url":"http://blog.freifunk.net","application_instructions":"First steps\n===\n\nPlease take a look on our [ideas page](https://wiki.freifunk.net/ideas) and select the idea you like.

All tools are specifically licensed open source. Organizations all over the world use our tools.\n\nInformation - In addition to raising awareness, we provide details to better secure assets. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional information, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.\n\nThe Honeynet Project uses GSoC as a incubator for new R&D projects, and to recruit active new members.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"MIT license (MIT)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/RSRF8q5-UYrc4BWqx5MfgDrJwuoG12dzlLozqkeAjEzqC0d9g2C4bvXUhLwFfNaGhpvgYMloQElsKRlTr4S49hRYbjMqDOQ","image_bg_color":"000000","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/ProjectHoneynet","blog_url":"https://honeynet.org/","application_instructions":"Please use our [application template](https://honeynet.org/gsoc2017/form) for your proposal.

You should describe what you plan to do as a solution for the problem you defined earlier.\n\n**Timeline:** With the timeline you show that you understand the problem, that you have thought hard about a solution, and that you have also broken the solution down into manageable bits.

Our work is crafted around the idea that we need to invent new ways to more efficiently use the resources that we have and use the knowledge that we gain to help guide the creation of the machines of tomorrow.  While we develop several software products, the library which is most heavily developed and core to our team is HPX. \n\nHPX (High Performance ParalleX) is a general purpose C++ runtime system for parallel and distributed applications of any scale. It strives to provide a unified programming model which transparently utilizes the available resources to achieve unprecedented levels of scalability.  This library strictly adheres to the C++11 Standard and leverages the Boost C++ Libraries which makes HPX easy to use, highly optimized, and very portable.  HPX is developed for conventional architectures including Linux-based systems, Windows, Mac, and the BlueGene/Q, as well as accelerators such as the Xeon Phi.\n\nWe envision HPX as a library which provides services to applications which makes writing efficient, maintainable, and scalable parallel and distributed codes much simpler than current popular paradigms.

Our work is crafted around the idea that we need to invent new ways to more efficiently use the resources that we have and use the knowledge that we gain to help guide the creation of the machines of tomorrow.  While we develop several software products, the library which is most heavily developed and core to our team is HPX. \n\nHPX (High Performance ParalleX) is a general purpose C++ runtime system for parallel and distributed applications of any scale. It strives to provide a unified programming model which transparently utilizes the available resources to achieve unprecedented levels of scalability.  This library strictly adheres to the C++11 Standard and leverages the Boost C++ Libraries which makes HPX easy to use, highly optimized, and very portable.  HPX is developed for conventional architectures including Linux-based systems, Windows, Mac, and the BlueGene/Q, as well as accelerators such as the Xeon Phi.\n\nWe envision HPX as a library which provides services to applications which makes writing efficient, maintainable, and scalable parallel and distributed codes much simpler than current popular paradigms.

The scale of problems and the amount of data available have made it infeasible to solve a meaningful problem in a single computer. As such, in such a scale, it is imperative to combine CPUs and accelerator cards such as GPUs to achieve one unified computing source. HPXCL aims at unifying kernel launch and data transfer into HPX asynchronous graph through seamless integration. However, the current implementation of the system with CUDA fails to achieve the desired performance improvement metrics while running in a cluster of computers. The proposal is aimed at improving the performance of CUDA-based HPXCL applications through an ‘Event’ triggered mechanism. Appropriate tests are also to be written to ensure necessary functionality performs as required. Standard benchmarking algorithms (Floyd Warshall, FFT etc.) will also be implemented in HPXCL, OpenCL and CUDA to validate, measure and improve the performance of the existing system, while also keeping in mind the new functionality added.","assignee_display_names":["diehlpk"],"program_year":2017},{"id":5531734673195008,"title":"HTML5: Physics Engine","subcategory":"html5","organization":{"id":6317890841083904,"name":"Catrobat","slug":"catrobat","website_url":"http://www.catrobat.org","category":"languages","contact_email":"contact@catrobat.org","mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/catrobat","irc_channel":"https://github.com/Catrobat/Catroid/wiki/Setup-working-environment","tagline":"Computational thinking for all through visual mobile programming frameworks","precis":"We want to enable especially teenagers to learn how to code and how to create their own games, animations or apps in a user-friendly framework by sticking together simple blocks.","description":"The Catrobat project develops useful frameworks to create games, animations, or apps easily within a short time. This set of creativity tools for smartphones, tablets, and browsers is inspired by the well-known Scratch framework by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab.\n\nThe motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.\n\nOur awarded Android app “Pocket Code” is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need of any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in a “Lego-like” style with blocks in just a few steps. Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special bricks for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro,...) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc.\n\nWe also work on frameworks for other OS and on making it available on browsers. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up to date to the current needs of the users. Motivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award, the Austrian National Innovation Award or the Re-Imagine Education Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org) our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions which will be released in the coming years.

We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.\n\nAt our core is the philosophy and politics of open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skillset, but is instead a creative and exploratory process.

Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.\n\nWe do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes [Processing (Java)](http://processing.org), [p5.js (JavaScript)](http://p5js.org), and [Processing.py (Python)](http://py.processing.org/), and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.\n\nThe Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or ability. We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.\n\nAt our core is the philosophy and politics of open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skillset, but is instead a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone.

The proposal primarily concerns implementing many of the popular image segmentation algorithms in pure Julia in the existing module `ImageFeatures.jl` (or a new module). Image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image by essentially assigning every pixel to a specific set based on the properties of this pixel and its neighborhood and henceforth dividing the image into segments and getting a more meaningful representation of the image. It is generally used to detect boundaries and high-level features and as a preprocessing step for compression and object detection algorithms which are impractical if applied directly on the whole image.

It allows users to analyse projects containing multiple languages with just one tool, using just one configuration and seeing just one user interface.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nWith coala, you create just one configuration file. It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code,  find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines.\nAll controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\n\n## For Users\n\ncoala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool.\nBesides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.\n\n## For Developers\n\nYou can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind. That means: no big boilerplate, just write one small object with one routine, add the parameters you like and see how coala automates the organisation of settings, user interaction and execution parallelisation.\n\n## For Newcomers\n\ncoala offers a great newcomer experience with an in depth step by step guide for your first contribution, extensive documentation of the whole workflow and fast and easy communication over the gitter channel.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Affero GNU Public License","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/WbQZ28FFe1fjF8nl3n3s7WaIA47dnpDpTdFRba3Y9iW34XtHL2PQanntLbUdmADFI_rjGwb6xX6ABMqLQtthAgOJW71ZFsA","image_bg_color":"ffffff","gplus_url":"","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/coala_analyzer","blog_url":"https://blog.coala.io","application_instructions":"Please read our FAQ at http://projects.coala.io/#/faq carefully and get started with our newcomer tutorial at https://coala.io/newcomer as well as being active on https://coala.io/chat.","topic_tags":["code analysis"],"technology_tags":["python"],"proposal_tags":["vulture","rstcheck","jetbrains","coala","gitmate"],"ideas_list":"https://projects.coala.io/","contact_method":"http://coala.io/chat","program_year":2017},"student":{"id":4980990406557696,"display_name":"nkprince007","program_year":2017},"abstract":"# About the product\n**GitHub**, **GitLab** and **BitBucket** support webhooks for common events like opening/closing/commenting on Merge Requests, creating Issues, etc. These webhooks could be configured for automated response using their own API's for comments, tests/integrations, etc. **GitMate** merely acts as a tunnel for these events and responds accordingly.

This measure aims to quantify the entropy of a given network, by firstly calculating the entropy of its nodes and edges which can then be observed as a type of centrality measure. Once all the node and edge centralities are obtained, we can derive from them the complexity of the whole network, which provides us not only with an interesting “one-value” description of the network, but also gives us the ability to compare multiple networks, or multiple parts of the same network.","assignee_display_names":["Giovanni Scardoni"],"program_year":2017},{"id":6133102572208128,"title":"Implement oVirt integration tests using Lago","subcategory":"improved feature","organization":{"id":5668068689707008,"name":"oVirt","slug":"ovirt","website_url":"http://www.ovirt.org","category":"end_user_applications","contact_email":"users@ovirt.org","mailing_list":"http://lists.ovirt.org/mailman/listinfo/users","irc_channel":"https://www.ovirt.org/community/","tagline":"Open virtual datacenter management for all","precis":"oVirt is a virtualization management platform that can manage entire datacenters of virtual machines with a simple and powerful interface.","description":"oVirt is a virtualization management application.

LibreOffice is compatible with many file formats like Microsoft® Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. At its heart though, LibreOffice is built around an open standard, the OpenDocument Format, as its native file format.\n\nLibreOffice is developed by users who, just like you, believe in the principles of Free Software and in sharing their work with the world in non-restrictive ways. The development of LibreOffice is supported by The Document Foundation which provides the infrastructure for the project.\n\nWe believe that users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software that we distribute. While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.\n\nThough the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution & skills.\n\nThe community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations. With tons of different roles in the project, we invite everyone to join us in our work and help us to make LibreOffice known, prosper, and accessible to all.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/oKFpzxvkUYRiTW0UKnMh-BD2nvvLpS3aMuXWDlE-3qTeM0cL2Kgi9z_O0aqji79LN1qxUUsMY2SMz7BMXx_a6itPOUNTRg","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":"https://plus.google.com/+libreoffice/posts","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/libreoffice","blog_url":"https://blog.documentfoundation.org/","application_instructions":"First you should have a look at the Google Summer of Code FAQ and GSoC Student Guide.

But some NAT rules even drop the UDP packets, only allowing TCP streams to go through. TCP encapsulation can reach through to hosts behind such NATs. An initiator must always try to send IKE_SA_INIT over UDP first, and if there are a certain number of transmission fails then only it should fall back to TCP. Another thing to do would be to schedule checks for UDP so we can go to establishing the tunnel using UDP if it becomes available and tear down the TCP IPsec tunnel. The above two steps are to be done as TCP encapsulation adds overheads and has performance trade offs compared to UDP, therefore we should always prefer using UDP unless required otherwise. Once the TCP support is added, we need to look into enabling ESPinTCP support in the kernel. The kernel must be able to identify TCP packets where the first 4 bytes are zero and we must tell the kernel to process ESPinTCP packets. Everything else will be done by following the draft RFC draft-ietf-ipsecme-tcp-encaps-09.","assignee_display_names":["Paul Wouters","Tuomo Soini"],"program_year":2017},{"id":4956121539280896,"title":"Implement Thanks support in Pywikibot","subcategory":"extensions","organization":{"id":4574972736438272,"name":"Wikimedia Foundation","slug":"wikimedia-foundation","website_url":"http://wikimediafoundation.org","category":"web","contact_email":"","mailing_list":"","irc_channel":"https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2017#Contact","tagline":"Global movement whose mission is to bring free educational content to the world","precis":"Wikimedia is a global movement whose mission is to bring free educational content to the world.","description":"We believe that knowledge should be free for every human being.

This means that Scala grows with you. At the root, the language’s scalability is the result of a careful integration of object-oriented and functional language concepts.\n\nScala is the preferred workhorse language for many mission critical server systems. The generated code is on a par with Java’s and its precise typing means that many problems are caught at compile-time rather than after deployment.\n\n# Object-Oriented\nScala is a pure-bred object-oriented language. Conceptually, every value is an object and every operation is a method-call. The language supports advanced component architectures through classes and traits.\n\n# Functional\nEven though its syntax is fairly conventional, Scala is also a full-blown functional language. It has everything you would expect, including first-class functions, a library with efficient immutable data structures, and a general preference of immutability over mutation.\n\n# Seamless Java Interop\nScala runs on the JVM. Java and Scala classes can be freely mixed, no matter whether they reside in different projects or in the same. They can even mutually refer to each other, the Scala compiler contains a subset of a Java compiler to make sense of such recursive dependencies.\n\n# Fun\nMaybe most important is that programming in Scala tends to be very enjoyable.

They split the input into chunks, and calculate the hash of each chunk using a simple (i.e. fast) hashing algorithm. What is important to note here is that the hash for the whole string is calculated incrementally, beginning from zero (or some known constant value), and for each chunk the checksum of the string including that chunk is calculated only using the old checksum (of the string without the new chunk) and the difference between the last chunk and the current one.\n\nSome useful rolling hash algorithms that could be employed are Fletcher’s checksum algorithms or the Adler-32 checksum.","assignee_display_names":["Tushar Gohad"],"program_year":2017},{"id":6476746187603968,"title":"Implementation of storage service","subcategory":"core","organization":{"id":4888954911326208,"name":"phpBB Forum Software","slug":"phpbb-forum-software","website_url":"https://www.phpbb.com","category":"social_communications","contact_email":"operations@phpbb.com","mailing_list":null,"irc_channel":"https://www.phpbb.com/support/irc","tagline":"phpBB is the most widely used free and open source forum software","precis":"Originally released in 2000, phpBB has since grown to include millions of users all over the world.

With that in mind, the number of light sources in a scene expands rapidly and requires a program to traverse the lights optimally when estimating their significance and impact for each scene point. As such, the many-light problem is introduced when calculating global illumination.\n\nThere are different algorithms to compute the global illumination, but each of those algorithms needs to sample all the lights of the scene first, and then do the computations. Optimizing the light sampling algorithm leads to faster and more efficient use of rendering time with the same degree of image realism, which are the exact same reasons why improvement of many-light sampling in Appleseed is required.\n\nWithin the proposal I've given an overview of the implementation approach of the new many-light sampling algorithm, split the overall problem into smaller pieces and tried to propose a realistic implementation timeline.","assignee_display_names":["Franz"],"program_year":2017},{"id":5422600755871744,"title":"Implementation of Token Bucket Filter and Heavy-Hitter Filter in ns-3","subcategory":"new feature","organization":{"id":5847900916547584,"name":"The ns-3 Network Simulator Project","slug":"the-ns-3-network-simulator-project","website_url":"https://www.nsnam.org","category":"other","contact_email":"consortium@nsnam.org","mailing_list":"https://www.nsnam.org/support/mailing-list/","irc_channel":"https://www.nsnam.org/developers/tools/irc/","tagline":"ns-3 is a packet-level network simulator for research and education.","precis":"ns-3 allows users to develop and experiment with models of computer networks.

Users of _ns-3_ can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in _ns-3_ is the high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds.  Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.\n\nProject details\n===========\n_ns-3_ has been in development since 2006 and has made 26 releases (ns-3.26 in October 2016).  _ns-3_ models are written in C++, with Python bindings and Python-based build tools.  The tool is in wide use in the field; we provide statistics about the project on our [web site](https://www.nsnam.org/overview/statistics/), but in summary, the community includes over 7000 people subscribed to our users forum, 1500 people subscribed to our developers mailing list, 200 recognized code contributors, and about 12 active maintainers.  The project's impact on the field is high:  the number of annual academic publications citing use of _ns-3_ is an imprecise count but appears to range in the several hundreds per year based on our searching of IEEE and ACM digital libraries and Google Scholar.

For example, we may want to give priority to some flows while limiting bandwidth of other flows or even perform packet classification. To solve such problems, we have a traffic control layer in ns-3 which intercepts the packets flowing between the L2 Net devices and any IP protocol. It uses several qdiscs like pfifo, HBT, RED, CoDel etc., in order to process these packets and perform scheduling or shaping. Currently the ns-3 traffic layer only contains traffic scheduling qdisc models (AQMs) and lacks realistic traffic shaping algorithms. This project aims to introduce the TBF and HHF algorithms into the ns-3 traffic control layer. TBF is a classless traffic shaper, that is used to control the flow rate or bandwidth of the throughput. HHF is a size-based qdisc that attempts to differentiate small and heavy flows. The goal is to catch the heavy flows and move them to a separate queue with less priority so that bulk traffic does not affect the latency of critical traffic.","assignee_display_names":["Stefano Avallone"],"program_year":2017},{"id":4757550437236736,"title":"Implementing 'Micro Mode' for Jitsi-Meet-Electron","subcategory":"new feature","organization":{"id":6399239132282880,"name":"Jitsi","slug":"jitsi","website_url":"https://jitsi.org","category":"social_communications","contact_email":"gsoc@jitsi.org","mailing_list":"https://jitsi.org/Development/MailingLists","irc_channel":"https://jitsi.org/Development/MailingLists","tagline":"Advanced Real-Time Communication","precis":"Jitsi is a set of open-source projects that allows you to easily build and deploy secure videoconferencing solutions.","description":"Jitsi is a set of open-source projects that allows you to easily build and deploy secure videoconferencing solutions.

I believe that providing a programming-language-level abstraction layer is an effective approach to significantly reduce the amount of time focused on how systems can fail, rather than how they should work. Such an approach should mainly consist in supplying systems programmers with basic functionalities in the following areas: node distribution, data replication and partition tolerance.\nBeing in an early adoption stage, Lasp needs applications that can serve as proof of concept in order to increase awareness of its capabilities as well as user adoption.

Provide a weekly plan with dates and deliverables. Leave time for getting familiar with the platform — ideally before, or in the community bonding period — and for documentation. If you plan to work on a language pair, make yourself familiar with testvoc and other quality controls, and factor those in. If you know of any breaks or absences beforehand, mention them and plan around them.\r\n- Get in contact ASAP!: We get lots of proposals: only a few are good. Contact your potential mentor as soon as possible: send your proposal to the mailing list, hang out on IRC, ask for feedback, and refine your application based on feedback. If you are remembered, you are more likely to be picked.\r\n- Read the Ideas Page!

The Foundation’s mission is to promote software literacy within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology-related fields — and to make these fields accessible to diverse communities. Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.\n\nWe do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes [Processing (Java)](http://processing.org), [p5.js (JavaScript)](http://p5js.org), and [Processing.py (Python)](http://py.processing.org/), and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.\n\nThe Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or ability. We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.\n\nAt our core is the philosophy and politics of open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skillset, but is instead a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. We believe software literacy and an understanding of media of all kinds is essential knowledge for today.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU Library or \"Lesser\" General Public License version 2.1 (LGPL-2.1)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/2Wa4Zi7TvMnCYAF9_ijUWrAa6VM2GvfPIdCffm7nsun-9O7nUPF-RsvBty_hFhrv4KcULNyhat_t_1pJiHxu7JhHLVlTWTs","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/processingorg","blog_url":"https://medium.com/@processingorg","application_instructions":"Thanks for your interest in the Processing Foundation!

For all of our projects, it's incredibly important that things are kept as simple and user-friendly as possible. Our work is not for developers. It's for people who are less familiar with code, and/or just want to get things done. We're far less interested in features to make the environments more powerful for advanced users than we are in features that make it easier to handle tasks that are common for a wide range of our audience. \n\nYou should feel free to propose your idea however you see fit.

There are more and more free wireless groups that meet regularly access in villages and cities.\n\nHardware and Software\n----\n\nMost devices in our networks are routers for home use. They should run with LEDE. In our local communities there are a lot of different approaches for different routing protocols, monitoring systems and map solutions. LEDE as OS for routers and OLSR, BATMAN and Babel as routing daemons are only a few examples of software developed together with freifunk.\nYou can find a great variety of topics where you can go on with wireless communities.

At CloudCV, we are building tools that enables researchers to build, compare and share start-of-the-algorithms. We believe that one shouldn’t have to be an AI expert to have access to cutting edge vision algorithms. Likewise, researchers shouldn’t have to worry about building a service around their deep learning models to showcase and share it with others.  \n\nCloudCV consists of three major platforms: \n\n**Origami** is a AI-as-a-service solution that allows researchers to easily convert their deep learning models into an online service that is widely accessible to everyone without the need to setup the infrastructure, resolve the dependencies, and build a web service around the deep learning model. By lowering the barrier to entry to latest AI algorithms, we provide developers, researchers and students the ability to access any model using a simple REST API call.\n\n**Fabrik** is an online collaborative platform to build, visualize and train deep learning models by a simple drag-and-drop approach. It allow researchers to collaboratively develop and debug models using a web GUI that allows importing, editing and exporting networks from widely popular frameworks like Caffe and Keras.\n\n**EvalAI** is an evaluation server that will host AI challenges like Visual Question Answering, Image Captioning. In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to compare an algorithm solving a given task with other existing approaches.

With huge multimedia contents available on web, web developers are in need of wide array of image and vision processing algorithms in JavaScript to build innovative applications, such as facial detection in live WebRTC streaming. And this requirement is even more essential for emerging usages on web, such as Web Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality (WebVR). The OpenCV is the de-facto standard C/C++ library for image and vision processing extensively used by computer vision community. But OpenCV is unavailable to web applications today. Thanks to OpenCV.js, an open source project initiated in Parallel Architectures and Systems Group at UC Irvine, by utilizing Emscripten LLVM-to-JavaScript compiler, it makes the first step to prove OpenCV can be exposed to web with high performance. This proposal aims to merge OpenCV.js into official OpenCV repository which makes JavaScript as one of the language bindings of OpenCV. So it requires refactoring the structure, addressing several shortcomings and code optimization of existing OpenCV.js.","assignee_display_names":["Sajjad Taheri"],"program_year":2017},{"id":4936518838779904,"title":"Improve Background Subtraction with Aggregated Saliency","subcategory":"background subtraction","organization":{"id":5987197309157376,"name":"OpenCV","slug":"opencv","website_url":"http://opencv.org","category":"graphics","contact_email":"opencv-gsoc-2017@googlegroups.com","mailing_list":"https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/GSoC_2017","irc_channel":"http://opencv.org","tagline":"Open Source Computer Vision and Machine Learning Library","precis":"OpenCV, the Open Source Computer Vision Library includes state of the art computer vision and deep learning algorithms.

Two proposed bottom-up saliency methods use low level cues such as boundary connectivity, local contrast of the image areas to their surroundings and sliding window approach. The other proposed top-down saliency method uses high level cues pretrained on ImageNet. Three proposed saliency methods are all better than current OpenCV saliency module. With the result from multiple saliency methods,  background subtraction can be performed by using exponentially decaying method or aggregated saliency optimization framework. The proposed approach tend to be more robust when the background is highly dynamic or the camera is in motion compared with current OpenCV Background Subtraction module.","assignee_display_names":["Antonella Cascitelli"],"program_year":2017},{"id":4999768540446720,"title":"Improve Blendyn","subcategory":"multibody dynamics","organization":{"id":6489010458329088,"name":"MBDyn","slug":"mbdyn","website_url":"http://www.mbdyn.org/","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"mbdyn@aero.polimi.it","mailing_list":"http://lists.mbdyn.org/mailman/listinfo/mbdyn-users","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"High fidelity multibody dynamics engine with extended capabilities","precis":"MBDyn is trusted worldwide to simulate the aeroelastic and viscous dynamics of vehicles from helicopters to semitrailers and allows FEM/CFD coupling through a variety of interfaces","description":"**MBDyn** is:\n* the first [free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) general purpose [Multibody Dynamics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multibody_system) analysis software\n* a command-line, direct initial-value problem solver with a large versatile multifield element library\n* a research tool developed by the community and used extensively in academia and industry \n* released under GNU's GPL 2.1.\n\n[**Blendyn**](http://github.com/zanoni-mbdyn/blendyn/wiki) is a **Blender** addon to [visualize in 3D](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5n0OgskIMc&list=PLTtFbiep140gc-f-x14ltv0N7YZNzvioF) the results of **MBDyn**.

It allows users to analyse projects containing multiple languages with just one tool, using just one configuration and seeing just one user interface.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nWith coala, you create just one configuration file. It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code,  find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines.\nAll controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\n\n## For Users\n\ncoala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool.\nBesides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.\n\n## For Developers\n\nYou can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind. That means: no big boilerplate, just write one small object with one routine, add the parameters you like and see how coala automates the organisation of settings, user interaction and execution parallelisation.\n\n## For Newcomers\n\ncoala offers a great newcomer experience with an in depth step by step guide for your first contribution, extensive documentation of the whole workflow and fast and easy communication over the gitter channel.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Affero GNU Public License","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/WbQZ28FFe1fjF8nl3n3s7WaIA47dnpDpTdFRba3Y9iW34XtHL2PQanntLbUdmADFI_rjGwb6xX6ABMqLQtthAgOJW71ZFsA","image_bg_color":"ffffff","gplus_url":"","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/coala_analyzer","blog_url":"https://blog.coala.io","application_instructions":"Please read our FAQ at http://projects.coala.io/#/faq carefully and get started with our newcomer tutorial at https://coala.io/newcomer as well as being active on https://coala.io/chat.","topic_tags":["code analysis"],"technology_tags":["python"],"proposal_tags":["vulture","rstcheck","jetbrains","coala","gitmate"],"ideas_list":"https://projects.coala.io/","contact_method":"http://coala.io/chat","program_year":2017},"student":{"id":5395434617962496,"display_name":"Hemang Kumar","program_year":2017},"abstract":"Currently, the coala Online module lacks support for all the bears.

Chapel is implemented with portability in mind, permitting Chapel to run on multicore desktops and laptops, commodity clusters, and the cloud, in addition to the high-end supercomputers for which it was designed. Chapel's design and development are being led by Cray Inc. in collaboration with academia, computing centers, and industry. Chapel offers a unique experience for students to work on projects involving high-performance computing, parallel programming, and compiler development.\n\n# Core features\n\n**Native Parallelism**\n\nChapel supports parallelism at the language level. For instance, Chapel provides a \"coforall\" loop, which is similar to a \"for\" loop and creates a separate task per iteration of the loop body. These explicit parallelism features make it easier to reason about the parallelism in your algorithm and program.\n\n**Data and Task Locality**\n\nWhen working on a large machine, the location of some data relative to the task which uses it or other data with which it must work plays a key role in performance. Chapel provides features which allow you to control that placement, both within a data structure and outside it.\n\n**Multiresolution Philosophy**\n\nChapel is designed around a multiresolution philosophy, permitting users to initially write very abstract code and then incrementally add more detail until they are as close to the machine as their needs require.\n\n**Modern Language Features**\n\nChapel supports code reuse and rapid prototyping via object-oriented design, type inference, and features for generic programming.\n\n**Interoperability**\n\nExisting code from other languages can be integrated into Chapel programs (or vice-versa) via interoperability features.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ouhiO9cOmNc2otF9_uh-s1fRB4kbfn9-x9gjGtLmY2DccpHt3zWa1gUS17PrDZzpm0L1djadVeO9yOZ2501T2udHmY0LsF4","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/chapellanguage","blog_url":"https://www.facebook.com/ChapelLanguage","application_instructions":"Please see: http://chapel.cray.com/gsoc/apply.html","topic_tags":["programming languages","compilers","high performance computing","distributed computing","parallel computing"],"technology_tags":["chapel","python","high performance computing","c","c++"],"proposal_tags":["libraries and applications","compatibility","compiler","runtime","infrastructure","other"],"ideas_list":"http://chapel.cray.com/gsoc/ideas.html","contact_method":"chapel_info@cray.com","program_year":2017},"student":{"id":5557151612272640,"display_name":"Przemysław Leśniak","program_year":2017},"abstract":"This project is about improving LLVM backend for chapel compiler.
