It quickly became and remains one of the most important reference databases in genomics, following the rapid development of the field. Its initial mission included finding all of the genes in the human genome. A year later, the mouse genome was published and we developed tools to directly compare genomes across species. Over the following decade, sequencing capacity increased exponentially (faster that Moore's Law in fact) and large surveys started examining more species and more individuals within each species. Our mission therefore expanded to store these datasets and statistics efficiently. Finally, in recent years, sequencing has been used to study the biochemical activity of the DNA molecule within the different tissues of an individual, prompting us to extend yet again our remit.\n\nAt the same time, Ensembl is an evolving software development project. Over 15 years, we moved from a central relational MySQL database with a Perl API and static web pages, to an array of storage technologies with a RESTful interface and an interactive front-end. We have dedicated portals for the large clades on the tree of life (known as Ensembl Genomes). Our annotations are produced through centuries of CPU time, coordinated by our powerful eHive analysis workflow manager.\n\nToday, we are a team of nearly 60 full time staff, housed at the European Bioinformatics Institute, and we collaborate with many external contributors around the world, in particular via our Github repositories where you can see us work day-to-day. We are at the intersection of two exciting and rapidly expanding fields, and there is no lack of interesting directions to push the project.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/XQCXz3F1WCF-jmsFe3JXG6Uu6wtzdTTawj2WTKthUqu1h8MnMPdRsu-Kcb-LlC5hLA_DW0NRuLCX-flo06TMuXDpFXUuHk4","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/ensembl","blog_url":"http://www.ensembl.info/","application_instructions":"Please structure your proposals as described in the instructions from the Google Summer of Code portal:\n\n* Name and contact information\n* Title\n* Synopsis\n* Benefits to the community\n* Deliverables\n* Related work\n* Biographical information\n\nYou’ll notice that the projects we suggest do not follow this format.

In particular, instead of naively focusing on the existence of the topic in the article, techniques with machine learning can broaden the search range by including more relevant secondary keywords in addition to the various variation of the given topic. Meanwhile, methods (such as SVM, nearest neighbor) can also be employed to prune the fetched articles to filter out those are irrelevant to our topic despite containing the exact words on the topic. Furthermore, due to the fact that articles may use different choices of words over time, time series analysis needs to be applied to keep track of the evolution of one topic during a certain period of time.

It really helps us to understand how you want to accomplish your goals, but even more so, it'll help you too. \n - Please note how much time per day/week you are going to spend on this project.\n - Specify your timezone, since so we can assign you a mentor in the same one. This helps ease communication.\n - Submit your proposal early\n - You can also choose a “backup” idea (the second task you probably want to do), so that in case of some conflicts (two students for one task) it will be easier to solve.","topic_tags":["reverse engineering"],"technology_tags":["c","rust","python","nodejs"],"proposal_tags":["new feature","refactoring","analysis","web","esil","debug"],"ideas_list":"http://radare.org/gsoc/2017/ideas.html","contact_method":"gsoc@radare.org","program_year":2017},"student":{"id":4905221210767360,"display_name":"Antide Petit","program_year":2017},"abstract":"The main goal of the task is to add more support on Windows platform.","assignee_display_names":["Maijin","Anton Kochkov"],"program_year":2017},{"id":6140283489091584,"title":"Proposal - Common Printing Dialog for Linux","subcategory":"printing","organization":{"id":5142442044030976,"name":"The Linux Foundation","slug":"the-linux-foundation","website_url":"http://www.linuxfoundation.org/","category":"operating_systems","contact_email":"till@linux.com","mailing_list":"https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/gsoc/google-summer-code-2017#if-you-have-questions","irc_channel":"https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/gsoc/google-summer-code-2017#if-you-have-questions","tagline":"A non-profit consortium dedicated to fostering the growth of Linux","precis":"The Linux Foundation is a non-profit consortium dedicated to fostering the growth of Linux.

Its modularity allows users to populate the framework with their own algorithms, allowing to put the focus on the signal processing implementation without worrying about how to embed that algorithm in a whole GNSS receiver. It also makes possible fair performance benchmarks using real GNSS signals, and its open source license allows free downloading, use and code inspection.\n\nThe proposed software receiver targets multi-constellation/multi-frequency architectures, pursuing the goals of efficiency, modularity, interoperability, and flexibility demanded by user domains that require non-standard features, such as earth observers or geodesists, and allowing applications such as the observation of the ionosphere, GNSS reflectometry, signal quality monitoring, space weather, and high-accuracy positioning based on carrier-phase navigation techniques. In this project, we focus on signal processing, understood as the process between the ADC and the computation of code and phase observables, including the demodulation of the navigation message. We purposely omit data processing, understood as the computation of the navigation solution from the observables and the navigation message, since there are a number of well-established libraries and applications for that (also in the open source side, such as GPSTk or RTKLIB).","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/2y3d9rTodPuBtEFoBUxpqcxfzyoUvQX4a_QI1Lv_i3KGvgMNP_mhqH7_C9ODQaGTWAbfC__XFFbLb4KdPu4tRNDoS2rHoT0","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"If you are an eligible and interested student, read through the list and note the projects you are interested in.

For this reason, it is crucial to guarantee a certain high quality of service (QoS). This QoS may be degraded by the presence of spurious undesirable signals coming from jammers that could degrade partially (or totally) the bandwidth of the desired GNSS signal.\nBasically, two kinds of Radio Frequency Interferences (RFI) can disturb a GNSS signal. Each one has its own characteristic spectral feature and a classification based on that is described as following:\n•\tContinuous wave interferences (CWI): a perturbation of a relative small part of the spectrum and can be mitigated by means of a notch filter.\n•\tShort pulsed interferences: with an instantaneous bandwidth that usually covers the entire GNSS band and can be partially removed by means of a blanking filter. \nTwo interference detection and mitigation algorithms will be evaluated in order to implement a new Signal conditioner block into GNSS-SDR.

Its core mission is to provide individuals and small studios with a complete, reliable, fully open rendering package.\n\nOver the years appleseed has been used on several projects including [TV documentaries](https://vimeo.com/81199785), ads, promotional videos and [an animation short](http://www.fetchaveryshortfilm.com/).\n\n# Paradigm\n\nappleseed implements a modern workflow based on path tracing that enables artifact-free, single pass rendering with very little technical tuning. It is simultaneously capable of strictly unbiased rendering when total accuracy matters, and biased rendering when artistic freedom and shorter rendering time are paramount.\n\n# Features\n\nappleseed supports fully programmable shading via [Sony Pictures Imageworks' Open Shading Language](https://github.com/imageworks/OpenShadingLanguage) (OSL), RGB/spectral/mixed rendering, fast and robust transformation and deformation motion blur, state-of-the-art ray traced subsurface scattering, exhaustive Python and C++ APIs and many other production-oriented features.\n\n# Ecosystem\n\nAlong with the core renderer, the team is actively developing high quality integrations into Autodesk Maya and Autodesk 3ds Max. appleseed is also the default rendering engine of [Image Engine’s Gaffer](http://www.gafferhq.org/).\n\n# Timeline\n\nappleseed was founded in May 2009 by François Beaune, a former rendering engineer from the core R&D team at mental images (now NVIDIA).\n\nIn October 2011, the development of appleseed benefited from a technology sharing agreement with Jupiter Jazz Limited and received funding for one year.

Here we propose an unsupervised distributed fuzzing-based continuous software testing framework, allowing minimum developer intervention, detecting and reporting software bugs on-the-fly by closely embedding into existing libvirt community developer workflow in a scalable and CI fashion. This novel Continuous Fuzzing Framework (CFF) will allow evaluation of an array of fuzzers of diverse characteristics and it will allow experimentation of customized fuzzers to fine tune performance in order to find different types of bugs. Potentially, this extensible closely community-tied CFF would also benefit other open source communities of the like.","assignee_display_names":["Martin Kletzander","Michal Privoznik"],"program_year":2017},{"id":5197021490184192,"title":"QGIS Web API and remote control Plugin (for Notebook integration)","subcategory":"qgis","organization":{"id":4660070039158784,"name":"OSGeo","slug":"osgeo","website_url":"http://www.osgeo.org/","category":"end_user_applications","contact_email":"soc@lists.osgeo.org","mailing_list":"http://www.osgeo.org/content/faq/mailing_lists.html#discuss","irc_channel":"https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/IRC","tagline":"Open Source Geospatial Foundation","precis":"OSGeo is a non-profit organization serving as an umbrella organization for the Open Source Geospatial community.","description":"OSGeo is a non-profit organization serving as an umbrella organization for the Open Source Geospatial community in general and several code projects in particular:\n\n## *Web Mapping* ##\n\ndeegree, geomajas, GeoMOOSE, GeoServer, Mapbender, MapFish, MapGuide Open Source, MapServer, OpenLayers\n\n## *Desktop Applications* ##\n\nGRASS GIS, gvSIG, Marble, QGIS\n\n## *Geospatial Libraries* ##\n\nFDO, GDAL/OGR, GEOS, GeoTools, OSSIM, PostGIS\n\n## *Metadata Catalogues* ##\n\nGeoNetwork, pycsw\n\n## *Content Management Systems* ##\n\nGeoNode\n\n## *Other Incubating Projects* ##\n\nistSOS, MetaCRS, Opticks, Orfeo ToolBox (OTB), PyWPS, Team Engine, ZOO-Project\n\n## *Other (non-code) Projects* ##\n\nGeoForAll (Education and Curriculum), OSGeo-Live DVD, Public Geospatial Data\n\nWe host regional and international FOSS4G conferences with typical attendance of 500-1000+ geospatial developers, industry and government leaders, and researchers.

By allowing the user to mark a folder, file or file type as untrusted, the need for a user to constantly keep themselves in check is eliminated, and unnecessary actions that must be frequently repeated during the course of working with sensitive or semi-trusted data are discarded.\n\nThese features and implementations are discussed in detail along with possible future developments should there be excess time towards the end of the event.

The main objective of the project, called **ProvinciaWiFi** (later renamed [WiFi Metropolitano](http://www.cittametropolitanaroma.gov.it/index.php/wifimetropolitano-english-version)), was to take a decisive step to reduce the existing **digital divide** by fostering and facilitating the use of ICT by citizens.\nFrom the outset it was decided to commit the project to a completely open philosophy. For this reason a clear choice towards open software and operating systems and the availability of every modification, update and improvement to the community was made. The same approach was adopted for the knowledge and the experience acquired within the project. In order to pursue this goals the Province of Rome called the university consortium *CASPUR* (later merged in the [CINECA](https://www.cineca.it/en) consortium) to develop the technical solution. In this context, a research project conducted by the *CINECA* consortium found its perfect application. This project proposed an innovative methodology for the distribution of networks (more precisely Virtual LANs used for Wi-Fi connectivity) between geographically distant sites. \n\nThe methodology adopted made it possible to host public connectivity services on non-dedicated network infrastructures (e.g.: private xDSL) that for technical and legal reasons could not be used as such. \u2028This is not the sole advantage that OpenWISP gave to *WiFi Metropolitano*: embracing the resource-sharing philosophy – typical of open projects – anyone can contribute to the network expansion simply by hosting an access point.\n\n\u2028The software tools and the architectures, including the OpenWISP 2 [wifi controller](http://openwisp.org/whatis.html#wifi-controller) and different [NetJSON](http://netjson.org/) implementations used in OpenWISP,  are released to the public free of charge under open-source licenses, we hope this will allow a broader audience to benefit from this work and improve upon it.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/pNekwasncafkQ2pz4_5TwyxaZHDyy1AU6rHJ-FFGNzL0Fag6orGBoWECJmHQ_wxWkAb0GhFjdTzcysB7EBjQrSzJ1Pnogw0","image_bg_color":"333","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/openwisp","blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"Then send us an email with the following details:\n\n**1.

While we develop several software products, the library which is most heavily developed and core to our team is HPX. \n\nHPX (High Performance ParalleX) is a general purpose C++ runtime system for parallel and distributed applications of any scale. It strives to provide a unified programming model which transparently utilizes the available resources to achieve unprecedented levels of scalability.  This library strictly adheres to the C++11 Standard and leverages the Boost C++ Libraries which makes HPX easy to use, highly optimized, and very portable.  HPX is developed for conventional architectures including Linux-based systems, Windows, Mac, and the BlueGene/Q, as well as accelerators such as the Xeon Phi.\n\nWe envision HPX as a library which provides services to applications which makes writing efficient, maintainable, and scalable parallel and distributed codes much simpler than current popular paradigms. Currently HPX is used to develop scientific and industrial applications and in the future we hope to expand its influence to include common applications that touch our everyday lives.\n\nIf you are looking for a project which incorporates cutting edge HPC research, runtime library development, and C++ standardization check out our [ideas page](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/wiki/GSoC-2017-Project-Ideas) and contact us either though the #ste||ar channel on IRC (Freenode) or via an email at <hpx-users@stellar.cct.lsu.edu>","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Boost Software License (BSL-1.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/tmnJNkvDOEF7e1V0X-BV_NBiVDrwvSZatV7QwWroeMkZiaZF2rVjyT4qilSkaBiEyzycmkP_0aiEMcHqj29PLpBScbCUN-0","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":"http://stellar-group.org/blog/","application_instructions":"Please see our complete instructions for proposal submission [here](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/wiki/GSoC-Submission-Template)","topic_tags":["runtime systems","c++ standardizaion","algorithms","parallel computing","high performance computing"],"technology_tags":["c++","boost","hpx","c++17 parallel stl","parallel algorithms"],"proposal_tags":["hpx","libgeodecomp","parallel algorithms","application","optimization","library"],"ideas_list":"https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/wiki/GSoC-2017-Project-Ideas","contact_method":"hpx-users@stellar.cct.lsu.edu","program_year":2017},"student":{"id":6682251587747840,"display_name":"Denis Blank","program_year":2017},"abstract":"Currently the following important functions of the HPX API:\n\n- `hpx::util::unwrapped`\n- `hpx::wait_(all|any|each|some)`\n- `hpx::when_(all|any|each|some)`\n- `hpx::dataflow`\n\nonly offer nonsatisfiable capabilities for nested `hpx::future` types inside homogeneous and heterogeneous containers.\n\nIn order to fully support the requirements for accepting argument types described in [#2456](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/issues/2456), [#1404](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/issues/1404), [#1400](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/issues/1400) and [#1126](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/issues/1126) this proposal intends to extend the capabilities of the functions listed above to access nested `hpx::future` types as well as unwrapping such types.

Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.\n\nWe do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes [Processing (Java)](http://processing.org), [p5.js (JavaScript)](http://p5js.org), and [Processing.py (Python)](http://py.processing.org/), and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.\n\nThe Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or ability. We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.\n\nAt our core is the philosophy and politics of open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skillset, but is instead a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. We believe software literacy and an understanding of media of all kinds is essential knowledge for today.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU Library or \"Lesser\" General Public License version 2.1 (LGPL-2.1)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/2Wa4Zi7TvMnCYAF9_ijUWrAa6VM2GvfPIdCffm7nsun-9O7nUPF-RsvBty_hFhrv4KcULNyhat_t_1pJiHxu7JhHLVlTWTs","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/processingorg","blog_url":"https://medium.com/@processingorg","application_instructions":"Thanks for your interest in the Processing Foundation!

There you'll find links to all of the relevant github repositories as well as lists of topics and projects for which we are actively seeking help. If you have questions about an idea or need guidance on forming your proposal, please post to the [Processing Forum](https://forum.processing.org/two/categories/summer-of-code-2017). \n\nFor GSoC, we actively seek help with features we know we need, but also look to applicants to propose ideas we haven't thought of ourselves. If you have an idea for a new feature for any of our environments, it's generally preferable to propose it as a library or mode so that it can be developed and tested as a standalone project. For all of our projects, it's incredibly important that things are kept as simple and user-friendly as possible. Our work is not for developers. It's for people who are less familiar with code, and/or just want to get things done.

This means that Scala grows with you. At the root, the language’s scalability is the result of a careful integration of object-oriented and functional language concepts.\n\nScala is the preferred workhorse language for many mission critical server systems. The generated code is on a par with Java’s and its precise typing means that many problems are caught at compile-time rather than after deployment.\n\n# Object-Oriented\nScala is a pure-bred object-oriented language. Conceptually, every value is an object and every operation is a method-call. The language supports advanced component architectures through classes and traits.\n\n# Functional\nEven though its syntax is fairly conventional, Scala is also a full-blown functional language. It has everything you would expect, including first-class functions, a library with efficient immutable data structures, and a general preference of immutability over mutation.\n\n# Seamless Java Interop\nScala runs on the JVM. Java and Scala classes can be freely mixed, no matter whether they reside in different projects or in the same.

This is a long-term aspiration for Oppia, the tool which allows users to collaboratively create interactive tutorial experiences online.\n\n# Interactive learning\nOppia teaches content in small units called _explorations_. _Learners_ (users who visit Oppia to learn something) explore a new topic through an exploration. Explorations are dynamic and interactive, meaning there are multiple paths through the exploration depending on the answers the learner submits (similar to video games). Different answers result in Oppia responding differently. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach.\n\nA user may repeatedly struggle on a certain question. Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor; an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make.\n\n# Community-driven content creation\nThe other half of Oppia is a community of _creators_ (users who create explorations). Oppia offers tools for creating new explorations with the goal of allowing anyone to teach just about anything. Creating explorations is very much like creating a video game, and we face some similar challenges. Our exploration editor needs to help creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, or facilitate easily creating targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners).

Therefore, it is important to ensure that students feel engaged and comfortable with the lessons. The concept of Explorations make sure that a lesson is properly paced and interactive by providing the learner with feedback at each step. If the learner feels lost or is stuck at a particular card, a “fallback” is triggered which provides the learner with hints and sometimes full answers to help him/her advance to the next card. Currently, this fallback is enabled/programmed by the exploration creators which gets triggered after ‘X’ unsuccessful attempts. However, it is found that learners need not always be ready for these “fallbacks”, so a better approach would be to have a student-initiated hint system. This way the student would have more control of when he/she receives a hint. Also, cards may have a final hint which explains how to solve the problem, thus helping the student progress to the next card. This project aims to build such a system.","assignee_display_names":["Joshua Cano","Kevin Lee","Tony Jiang"],"program_year":2017},{"id":4959767570153472,"title":"Research Data Metadata Extraction","subcategory":"research data metadata extraction","organization":{"id":4630502569934848,"name":"Zenodo","slug":"inveniozenodo","website_url":"https://zenodo.org","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"info@zenodo.org","mailing_list":null,"irc_channel":"https://gitter.im/zenodo/zenodo","tagline":"A free and open digital archive for the long-tail of science.","precis":"Zenodo is a free and open digital archive built by CERN and OpenAIRE, enabling researchers to share and preserve research output in any size, format and from all fields of research","description":"# Why Open Science?\nScience is only at its finest when its fruits are accessible to anyone in the world, when the data is publicly available to support the claims in the paper, and when the software is treated as first-class citizen in the scientific publishing, so that the results can be analyzed, reproduced and refined by anyone, today and 5, 10 or 100 years in the future.

Every user in the free wireless network provides his or her wireless LAN router for data transfer to other participants. In return, he or she can also transmit data, such as text, music and movies through a free internal network or use services setup by participants to chat, call or play online games. We use mesh networks.\n\nUmbrella Organisation\n-----\n\nWe act as umbrella organisation for other wireless communities like [Ninux](http://ninux.org), [qaul.net](http://qaul.net), [Guifi.net](http://guifi.net) or [WLAN Slovenija](https://wlan-si.net/) and communites developing software we extensivly use like [LEDE/OpenWRT](https://lede-project.org/), [OLSR](http://www.olsr.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page), [BATMAN](https://www.open-mesh.org/projects/open-mesh/wiki), [libremesh](http://libremesh.org/) or [retroshare](http://retroshare.sourceforge.net/).\n\nLocal communities provide software adapted to their own needs on their websites. There are more and more free wireless groups that meet regularly access in villages and cities.\n\nHardware and Software\n----\n\nMost devices in our networks are routers for home use. They should run with LEDE. In our local communities there are a lot of different approaches for different routing protocols, monitoring systems and map solutions. LEDE as OS for routers and OLSR, BATMAN and Babel as routing daemons are only a few examples of software developed together with freifunk.\nYou can find a great variety of topics where you can go on with wireless communities. We're looking for people working on new hardware drivers, improving routing protocols, developing network monitoring tools and user interface topics on the web interfaces, helping us with new features and tools to organize decentralized communities.\n\nCommon freifunk goals\n----\n\n* Educating and creating awareness on the subject of communication and freedom of information\n* Reducing the digital divide\n* Unhindered distribution of knowledge and resources\n* Empowering people to build and operate their own networks\n* Promote and support existing and new social structures\n\nAs we are decentralized there are some challenges, e.g. to get and show information about communities, working together with all those communties.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/Tu80Q6-06ZCb0Pe0dOXSDlu5rWIloTngJ-yFtxiWcWaMdulrE4QNZvgLfXwzeFWh7aXw_AeTulfhn-bY_FFnC8DH5vKghg","image_bg_color":"","gplus_url":"","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/freifunk","blog_url":"http://blog.freifunk.net","application_instructions":"First steps\n===\n\nPlease take a look on our [ideas page](https://wiki.freifunk.net/ideas) and select the idea you like.

You should propose a clear list of deliverables, explaining exactly what you promise to do and what you do not plan to do.\n\n**Implementation:** This section can be longer and more detailed. You should describe what you plan to do as a solution for the problem you defined earlier.\n\n**Timeline:** With the timeline you show that you understand the problem, that you have thought hard about a solution, and that you have also broken the solution down into manageable bits. A modest, realistic and detailed timeline is much better than a timeline that promises to move mountains.\n\n**About me:** Write a few lines about you.","topic_tags":["linux distribution","web development","realtime","virtualization","conferences"],"technology_tags":["ruby on rails","javascript ","docker","linux","angular.js"],"proposal_tags":["osem","portus","jangouts","yast","other"],"ideas_list":"http://101.opensuse.org/gsoc/","contact_method":"opensuse-project@opensuse.org","program_year":2017},"student":{"id":5022523411398656,"display_name":"Linh Chi Bui","program_year":2017},"abstract":"Jangouts (for “Janus Hangouts”) is a videoconferencing tool based on WebRTC and Janus Gateway that provides a self-hosted open source alternative to Google Hangouts.

While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.\n\nThough the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution & skills.\n\nThe community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations.

Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time.

So, this project would also strive to provide a concise, clear and up-to-date documentation of the entire package.","assignee_display_names":["Sarah Elliott","Arseniy Gorin"],"program_year":2017},{"id":6139805137108992,"title":"ROS with PR2 integration in Unreal Engine","subcategory":"unreal engine","organization":{"id":5091360278315008,"name":"Institute for Artificial Intelligence","slug":"institute-for-artificial-intelligence-2","website_url":"http://ai.uni-bremen.de","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"gsoc2017iai@uni-bremen.de","mailing_list":"http://gsoc2017-at-iai@uni-bremen.de","irc_channel":"https://gitter.im/iai_gsoc17/general","tagline":"Research in Artificial Intelligence and Perception for Autonomous Mobile Robots","precis":"The Institute for Artificial Intelligence performs research in perception for robotics, object manipulation, plan-based robot control, and knowledge representation for robots.","description":"The Institute for Artificial Intelligence (IAI) at the University of Bremen, Germany, headed by Prof. Michael Beetz, investigates methods for cognition-enabled robot control.

This year the program has expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator  http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments have announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: detector and accelerator simulation (Falcon, Geant4, GeantV, Pythia, SixTrack), data analysis (ROOT, TMVA, scikit-HEP, Go-HEP), event reconstruction (CMS Tracking), data management (transfer2go) and many others.

The scope includes supporting more workspace configurations (multiple targets and active crates) as well as popularly requested IDE features, such as implementing code action mechanism on the server side, e.g. used for refactoring or running specific tests, or improving diagnostic data required for better code navigation. Providing good out-of-box IDE experience will substantially help with widespread adoption of Rust and support writing not only quality self-contained libraries, but also incentivize writing advanced end-user oriented applications.","assignee_display_names":["Nick Cameron"],"program_year":2017},{"id":4721624512200704,"title":"Rust support for KDevelop","subcategory":"kdevelop","organization":{"id":5351578790789120,"name":"KDE","slug":"kde","website_url":"http://kde.org","category":"end_user_applications","contact_email":"kde-community@kde.org","mailing_list":"https://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/kde-devel","irc_channel":"https://userbase.kde.org/IRC_Channels","tagline":"Experience Freedom!","precis":"The KDE community produces Free and Open Source Software and brings together artists, designers, programmers, translators, users, writers and other contributors from everywhere.","description":"KDE is an international team co-operating on development and distribution of Free, Open Source Software for desktop and portable computing.
