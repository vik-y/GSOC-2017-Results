				"description": "The [National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB)](http://www.nrnb.org) organizes the development of free, open source software technologies to enable network-based visualization, analysis, and biomedical discovery. Biomedical research is increasingly dependent on knowledge expressed in terms of networks, including gene, protein and drug interactions, cell-cell and viral-host communication, and vast social networks. Our technologies enable researchers to assemble and analyze these networks and to use them to better understand biological systems and, in particular, how they fail in disease. \n\nThe NRNB mentoring organization includes projects such as [Cytoscape](http://cytoscape.org/), [WikiPathways](http://wikipathways.org/), [SBML](http://sbml.org/), and [cBioPortal](http://cbioportal.org/). *This is a great opportunity to work at the intersection of biology and computing!* For example, Cytoscape is downloaded over **16,000 times per month** by researchers. We take mentoring seriously and are proud of our [>90% success rate](http://www.nrnb.org/alumni.html#gsoc-tab) with former students and projects. But don't take our word for it, read testimonials from prior NRNB students [students](http://www.nrnb.org/testimonials.html#student-tab) and [mentors](http://www.nrnb.org/testimonials.html#mentor-tab).\n\nFind out more about the software projects being developed in coordination with NRNB. Also refer to the [NRNB GSoC page](http://www.nrnb.org/gsoc.html)  for additional resources and application tips.",

			"abstract": "WikiPathways is an open and collaborative platform for sharing biological pathway information. It features an interactive diagram that aids the user in understanding the pathway. However, the educational capabilities of these diagrams can be improved. Studies show that when information is given in steps, with dynamic visual\naids, audience attention and understanding increases dramatically. Ideas presented graphically, as a “story\", are far easier to comprehend and remember than static information. Thus, step-by-step presentations of pathway diagrams would dramatically enhance the educational capabilities of WikiPathways. \n\nIn this proposal, a new \"Pathway Presenter\" is outlined that will enable biologists to create dynamic presentations of the pathways in WIkiPathways. This will allow for the creation of succinct and easily comprehensible diagrams that can be shared and embedded across multiple platforms.",

It is interlinked to many other datasets. The knowledge in DBpedia is exposed through a technology stack called *Linked Data*, which has been revolutionizing the way applications interact with the Web: with Linked Data technologies, all APIs are interconnected via standard Web protocols and languages.\n\n# The Web of data\nSuch *Web of data* provides useful knowledge that can complement the *Web of documents* in many ways. See, for instance, how bloggers tag their posts or assign them to categories in order to organize and interconnect their blog posts. This is a very simple way to connect unstructured text to a structure (hierarchy of tags). For more advanced examples, see how **BBC** has created the *World Cup 2010 website* by interconnecting textual content and facts from their knowledge base.\n\nOr, more recently, did you see that **IBM's Watson used DBpedia data to win the Jeopardy challenge**?\n\n# DBpedia Spotlight\n\n**DBpedia Spotlight** is an open source text annotation tool that connects text to Linked Data by marking names of things in text (we call that *spotting*) and selecting between multiple interpretations of these names (we call that *disambiguation*). For example, `Washington` can be interpreted in more than 50 ways including a state, a government or a person. You can already imagine that this is not a trivial task, especially when we're talking about millions of things and hundreds of types.\n\n# We are regularly growing our community through GSoC and can deliver more and more opportunities to you.",

				"description": "The STE||AR Group is an international team of researchers who understand that a new approach to parallel computation is needed.  Our work is crafted around the idea that we need to invent new ways to more efficiently use the resources that we have and use the knowledge that we gain to help guide the creation of the machines of tomorrow.  While we develop several software products, the library which is most heavily developed and core to our team is HPX. \n\nHPX (High Performance ParalleX) is a general purpose C++ runtime system for parallel and distributed applications of any scale. It strives to provide a unified programming model which transparently utilizes the available resources to achieve unprecedented levels of scalability.  This library strictly adheres to the C++11 Standard and leverages the Boost C++ Libraries which makes HPX easy to use, highly optimized, and very portable.  HPX is developed for conventional architectures including Linux-based systems, Windows, Mac, and the BlueGene/Q, as well as accelerators such as the Xeon Phi.\n\nWe envision HPX as a library which provides services to applications which makes writing efficient, maintainable, and scalable parallel and distributed codes much simpler than current popular paradigms. Currently HPX is used to develop scientific and industrial applications and in the future we hope to expand its influence to include common applications that touch our everyday lives.\n\nIf you are looking for a project which incorporates cutting edge HPC research, runtime library development, and C++ standardization check out our [ideas page](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/wiki/GSoC-2017-Project-Ideas) and contact us either though the #ste||ar channel on IRC (Freenode) or via an email at <hpx-users@stellar.cct.lsu.edu>",

So I will implement is_heap, partial_sort, partition, remove, merge, and unique.\nAfter this I will move on to #1338, which is about ensuring that these algorithms work seamlessly with distributed data structures like hpx::vector. I will extend as many of the remaining algorithms as possible in the timeframe. I will do this along with unit tests and performance tests.

				"description": "The STE||AR Group is an international team of researchers who understand that a new approach to parallel computation is needed.  Our work is crafted around the idea that we need to invent new ways to more efficiently use the resources that we have and use the knowledge that we gain to help guide the creation of the machines of tomorrow.  While we develop several software products, the library which is most heavily developed and core to our team is HPX. \n\nHPX (High Performance ParalleX) is a general purpose C++ runtime system for parallel and distributed applications of any scale. It strives to provide a unified programming model which transparently utilizes the available resources to achieve unprecedented levels of scalability.  This library strictly adheres to the C++11 Standard and leverages the Boost C++ Libraries which makes HPX easy to use, highly optimized, and very portable.  HPX is developed for conventional architectures including Linux-based systems, Windows, Mac, and the BlueGene/Q, as well as accelerators such as the Xeon Phi.\n\nWe envision HPX as a library which provides services to applications which makes writing efficient, maintainable, and scalable parallel and distributed codes much simpler than current popular paradigms. Currently HPX is used to develop scientific and industrial applications and in the future we hope to expand its influence to include common applications that touch our everyday lives.\n\nIf you are looking for a project which incorporates cutting edge HPC research, runtime library development, and C++ standardization check out our [ideas page](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/wiki/GSoC-2017-Project-Ideas) and contact us either though the #ste||ar channel on IRC (Freenode) or via an email at <hpx-users@stellar.cct.lsu.edu>",

So, implementing C++17 parallelism like N4409 is very important. Currently, most of parallel algorithms are already implemented as can be seen in #1141. But, still some algorithms are not implemented. My objective is implementing the rest of parallel algorithms except sorting algorithms in #1141. The list is as follows:\n - is_heap, is_heap_until\n - partition, partition_copy\n - remove, remove_if\n - inplace_merge, merge\n - unique, unique_copy.\n\nImprovement of ```hpx::parallel::util::scan_partitioner```\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCurrently, the ```scan_partitioner``` uses a sequential approach for propagation of partition results in step 2. If there are a large number of partitions and f2 (the function for propagation invoked in step 2) is heavy function, there may be performance issues. And the ```scan_partitioner``` performs scan individually and sequentially in each partition in step 1. When uses an operand which has unpredictable consuming time, performance seems to be bounded by the slowest partition in step 1. My objective is resolving these issues for improving ```scan_partitioner```.",

There's plenty of tools to manage audio/video, but it comes to subtitles, the few tools that exist are closed source and extremely expensive. CCExtractor is the one tool that is free, portable, open source and community managed that can take a recording from a TV show and generate an external subtitle file for it. \nIf you regularly watch content with subtitles you download from fan sites - you should know that the source file is most likely generated by CCExtractor. If you are a student in a university that uses subtitles for natural language study, you should know that most likely we are involved somehow. \nWhile we already support subtitles from North America, Europe, Australia and more, our world map is not yet complete. We are actively looking for students that want to help us fill the gaps.\nWe also want to automate many of the processes that are currently done manually, such as achieving perfect sync, or word by word (karaoke like) sync.",

For example, “I will modify the CCExtractor binary so that it's able to convert audio to text with perfect accuracy” is the same thing as sending your proposal to the trash. You need to have a plan.\n- Detail the timeline, week by week, explaining the deliverables for each week (pay special attention to the milestones within the GSoC timeline itself, of course) and how we should validate the results.\n- Detail what kind of support you will need for us. For example, if you are going to need test streams, hardware, access to a server, etc, let us know, so we can plan ahead.\n- Detail your expected working hours in UTC.\n- If you are going to be using 3rd party libraries (that's OK), make sure to validate that their license is compatible with GPLv2 (which is ours). List the libraries in your proposal. Check that they are multiplatform. If you will need to extend those libraries in any way please explain. In this case, your proposal should include time to get that extension submitted to the maintainers (we love to contribute to other projects).",

Specifically targeting personal computing, Haiku is a fast, efficient, simple to use, easy to learn, and yet very powerful system for computer users of all levels. Additionally, Haiku offers something over other open source platforms which is quite unique: The project consists of a single team writing everything from the kernel, drivers, userland services, tool kit, and graphics stack to the included desktop applications and preflets. While numerous open source projects are utilized in Haiku, they are integrated seamlessly. This allows Haiku to achieve a level of consistency that provides many conveniences, and is truly enjoyable to use by both end-users and developers alike.\n\nWhat’s so good about Haiku anyway?\n==============================\n\nThe key highlights that distinguish Haiku from other operating systems include:\n\n- Specific focus on personal computing\n- Custom kernel designed for responsiveness\n- Fully threaded design for great efficiency with multi-processor/core CPUs\n- Rich OO API for faster development\n- Database-like file system (BFS) with support for indexed metadata\n- Unified, cohesive interface\n\nWhy Haiku?\n==========\n\nThe Be Operating System introduced progressive concepts and technologies that we believe represent the ideal means to simple and efficient personal computing. Haiku is the realization of those concepts and technologies in the form of an operating system that is open source and free.\n\nWho is behind Haiku?\n=================\n\nHaiku is developed by a growing community of volunteer developers from all around the world. Additionally, Haiku also exists thanks to the dedicated support of a fervent and friendly community, and that of Haiku, Inc., a non-profit organization founded by former project leader Michael Phipps with the purpose of supporting the development of Haiku as well as the growth of both the community and the Haiku platform.",

So that the guest kernel doesn't have to have grant table support to be able to communicate with other guests. This should work on both x86 and ARM.",

Our global community of contributors ensures that end-users receive a stable, secure, and infinitely customizable product that's easy to deploy and maintain, while also being fun and simple to use every day.\n\n## Why choose phpBB?\nOriginally released in 2000, the latest version of the phpBB software has evolved to include support for multiple database engines (PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL/MariaDB, Oracle, MS SQL Server), user groups, an extendable permissions system, hierarchical subforums, file attachments, a variety of notification options (E-Mail, Jabber, ATOM feeds), OAuth authentication, Emojis, and a variety of other features as well as support for PHP 7 and 7.1. The phpBB Customization Database of styles and extensions offers administrators endless ability to adapt the software to their needs.\n\nOur strict security practices have resulted in a solid product with a proven track record greatly exceeding that of our commercial competitors. Likewise, our coding guidelines and collaborative development model ensure that code quality is a top priority while encouraging constant developer learning and growth.\n\n## phpBB and Google Summer of Code\nWe are proud to have previously participated in the GSoC program three times with great success. Former phpBB GSoC student have flown across the world to meet the rest of our team during our annual hackathon and have gone on to become long-term contributors to the project, some even joining the core development team.

				"description": "# Why Open Science?\nScience is only at its finest when its fruits are accessible to anyone in the world, when the data is publicly available to support the claims in the paper, and when the software is treated as first-class citizen in the scientific publishing, so that the results can be analyzed, reproduced and refined by anyone, today and 5, 10 or 100 years in the future. Principles of [Open Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) are at the core of the scientific method.\n\nMost of the scholarly communication today is done as it was a hundred years ago. The data supporting the claims in the paper can be difficult to acquire or even impossible to find, software used to produce the results is a collection of scripts rotting-away on a laptop or a USB stick, while the paper itself, after it's been published, is kept behind a publisher's paywall, and is not easily accessible to everyone. The scientific community has yet to fully appreciate the lessons taught by the FOSS movement, and Zenodo[1] was built to make Open Science a reality for everyone.\n\n# What is Zenodo?\nZenodo is an open and free digital archive, allowing all researchers from around the world to publish their papers, data and software, which then can be cited, accessed, analyzed and reproduced by anyone. Zenodo is built by the researchers and software engineers at [CERN](http://home.cern/) in collaboration with [OpenAIRE](https://www.openaire.eu/), sharing passion for Open Source and Open Science. Zenodo is both a free and public [service](https://zenodo.org), as well as Free and Open Source [Software](http://zenodo.readthedocs.io), based on [Invenio](http://invenio.readthedocs.io) - a general purpose digital library platform, and also a FOSS developed and used by CERN as well as other institutions worldwide. By contributing to Zenodo you will also contribute to Invenio, so not only will you aid Open Science, but also many other scientific institutes and academic libraries around the world!\n\n[1] The name, Zenodo, is derived from [Zenodotus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenodotus), the first librarian of the Ancient Library of Alexandria and father of the first recorded use of metadata, a landmark in library history.",

Here are the main tips to help you when writing your GSOC application with Apertium.\r\n\r\n- Be realistic: We're more likely to accept realistic ideas than far-out wacky ones. But if you have a wacky idea, we might still be interested if we can turn it into something achievable in 3 months.\r\n- Be appropriate: Demonstrate you have a knowledge of Apertium, how it works and the problem it has that you'd like to solve.\r\n- Have a plan: Three months may seem like a long time, but it isn't. Provide a weekly plan with dates and deliverables. Leave time for getting familiar with the platform — ideally before, or in the community bonding period — and for documentation. If you plan to work on a language pair, make yourself familiar with testvoc and other quality controls, and factor those in. If you know of any breaks or absences beforehand, mention them and plan around them.\r\n- Get in contact ASAP!: We get lots of proposals: only a few are good. Contact your potential mentor as soon as possible: send your proposal to the mailing list, hang out on IRC, ask for feedback, and refine your application based on feedback. If you are remembered, you are more likely to be picked.\r\n- Read the Ideas Page! If you find yourself asking 'do you have any Java/Python/Fortran/x86 assembler projects...' -- you didn't read the ideas page. Read the ideas page. \r\n\r\n1. http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Top_tips_for_GSOC_applications",

			"abstract": "Catalan to Sardinian (apertium-cat-srd):\nThe project has already started and currently the bidix is in the Staging section. The Catalan language is definitely the one that has the most resources in the Apertium platform. The cat-srd bidix has 2645 words with a trimmed coverage of 77.7% and a Wer rate of 34.8%: my goal is to bring coverage up to 86,5% and WER to 15%. The work that I think I can make concerns the increased coverage in bidix,  work on transfer rules lexical selection.\n\nApertium Italian to Sardinian (apertium ita-srd):\nLast year, thanks to Google Summer of Code program, the first Italian-Sardinian translator was released, apertium ita-srd. The project was a success.\nAs for apertium ita> srd the goal is to focus on transfer rules: through the structural differences highlighted by the completion of pending tests, this time srd>it requires the construction of new transfer rules that allow to solve problems like enclitics and proclítics (Sardinian there are words that have 3 enclitics and Italian 2, superlatives and NP possessive, lexical selection and morphological disambiguation.",
