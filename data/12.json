PEcAn automates analyses aimed at understanding and forecasting ecosystem responses through these models. \n\n# Transparency, repeatability, accessibility # \n\nPEcAn's scientific workflow management fully captures the informatics of where the model inputs came from, how they were processed, how sets of model runs were completed, and how the model output was post-processed and visualized for maximizing transparency and repeatability. PEcAn's intuitive web-based interface allows non-modelers or novices to use models and techniques developed by experts.\n\n# High functionality and performance #\n\nIn addition to making the PEcAn source code open source, the system is also available as a fully functional virtual application that runs on a wide range of operating systems.

For me, an important component of this project is to understand what kind of visualization would give an intuitive sense to any user given the data and to present them in a very clear and effective manner. Otherwise, the user could not draw inferences that we want to show them. This is the most interesting thing I like and it is my motivation to work on this project to master this art of visualization.","assignee_display_names":["Alexey Shiklomanov","Betsy Cowdery"],"program_year":2017},{"id":4803574507765760,"title":"Scikit-HEP project","subcategory":"scikit-hep","organization":{"id":4978158764818432,"name":"CERN-HSF","slug":"cern-hsf","website_url":"http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/activities/gsoc.html","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"hep-software-foundation-google-summer-of-code@googlegroups.com","mailing_list":"http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/activities/gsoc.html","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"CERN-HEPSoftwareFoundation, umbrella organization for particle physics in GSoC","precis":"CERN-HSF (High Energy Physics Software Foundation) is an umbrella organization for all high-energy physics-related projects in GSoC.

The HEP Software Foundation (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing. \n\nCERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, http://www.cern.ch) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as CERN-SFT group that provides common software for CERN's experiments. This year the program has expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator  http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments have announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: detector and accelerator simulation (Falcon, Geant4, GeantV, Pythia, SixTrack), data analysis (ROOT, TMVA, scikit-HEP, Go-HEP), event reconstruction (CMS Tracking), data management (transfer2go) and many others.

Ethereum blockchain is one example, that gives users to develop \"smart contracts\" that runs in the blockchain. This gives the ability to develop decentralized applications (or dApps).\n\nThis framework has given many developers to write a decentralized application without much effort, without needing distributed systems or cryptography knowledge. Unfortunately, because the technology being used is bleeding edge it is inevitable that attacks or hacks will target these apps for monetary reasons.\nBecause of the immutability property of Ethereum after publishing even if developers identify a critical bug in the contract it is not possible to correct it.\n\nThus, in order to fill the gap of not having a proper 'smart contract' compatible monitoring service, we propose to build a web application that can monitor other smart contracts in Ethereum and give the capability to safeguard its critical functions (Ether send and receive) and interact and visualize with smart contract functions in a much simpler way.","assignee_display_names":["Keshan Sodimana"],"program_year":2017},{"id":4908739594289152,"title":"Scrapinghub (dateparser) : Integrate unicode CLDR database with dateparser","subcategory":"scrapinghub","organization":{"id":5164886469378048,"name":"Python Software Foundation","slug":"python-software-foundation-2","website_url":"https://www.python.org","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"gsoc-general@python.org","mailing_list":"https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/gsoc-general","irc_channel":"http://python-gsoc.org/#contact","tagline":"Python is a programming language used by scientists & software developers alike.","precis":"Python is a popular high-level programming language used by scientists, developers, and many others who want to work more quickly and integrate systems more effectively.","description":"Python is a popular high-level programming language used by scientists, developers, and many others who want to work more quickly and integrate systems more effectively.

What would modders come up with if you could create and ship a mod with a few simple commands, making it available immediately for download in-game by others, in a secure sandboxed environment?\n\n## Minimal Engine\n\nOur engine is intended to be as bare-bone as possible, even excluding such basics as inventory, health, creatures, or combat. A series of minimal modules are meant to be bundled with the game's standard distribution to offer a sort of vanilla game experience, with a focus on commonly used systems that are often fragmented and re-implemented many times over. All such modules are community owned and maintained, guaranteed to work with every release.\n\n## Extensibility\n\nAny content is wrapped in modules ranging from tiny frameworks supporting commonly needed utility to large gameplay templates commonly referred to as mod packs in the Minecraft world, that in turn can depend on dozens of the smaller pieces, maximizing reusability.\n\nCreating a new module is as easy as running a single gradlew command, having a community repository created on GitHub is another single request away, and fetching source for any such community module is yet another single command. Dependency resolution is supported within the engine framework both for development and for runtime usage, including auto-downloading from a running game server to connecting clients.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/jBCJsq71CPnCSkqy1OQHtbvEGXWr8RINdfm9aQbd7NMq_gI4NuQzI4NEgUVOLQPZhLVey3yZe4jVC4F50BgWj2-35GhT-3w","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":"https://plus.google.com/b/103835217961917018533","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/Terasology","blog_url":"http://forum.terasology.org","application_instructions":"Thank you for your interest in our organization! :-)\n\nTo apply with us please go through the below list of requirements.

It includes\n\n- an effective data handling and storage facility,\n- a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,\n- a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,\n- graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and\n- a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.\n\nThe term “environment” is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.\n\nR, like S, is designed around a true computer language, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nMany users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/e6UifH3TR9p8a-8sKngoEkMHw_0yJ1ssFPNN1WH-gkUOHdRwf_qU-O5UVhN3co1AZzrI7atjqYKTtl6p-z6sKq65rRanTg","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":"http://www.r-bloggers.com/","application_instructions":"1. look for a project on\nhttps://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2017/wiki/table-of-proposed-coding-projects\n\n2.

Time series modeling using sentiment from text requires its own package because of the intrinsic challenge that for a given text we can compute sentiment in hundreds of different ways, as well as the large number of possibilities to pool sentiment across text and time. This additional layer of manipulation does not exist in standard time series analysis. The package aims to derive the optimal sentiment extraction and aggregation for the forecasting task. Aggregation can be optimized across several dimensions, for example word term weighting schemes or time lag structures. The package created therefore integrates the qualification of sentiment from text, the aggregation into different sentiment measures and the optimized forecasting based on these measures. No such integrated textual sentiment forecasting approach exists in any R package. The goal is to provide an automated means to measure the impact of sentiment in texts on a given variable, obtaining readily interpretable and useful outputs and an object to play with, when using this package.","assignee_display_names":["kboudt","Keven Bluteau","ArdiaD"],"program_year":2017},{"id":6560533825191936,"title":"Server API -     VXQueryVXQUERY-180 ( swagger )","subcategory":"from ideas list","organization":{"id":5416945173135360,"name":"Apache Software Foundation","slug":"apache-software-foundation","website_url":"http://www.apache.org","category":"other","contact_email":"dev@community.apache.org","mailing_list":"http://apache.org/foundation/mailinglists.html","irc_channel":"https://wiki.apache.org/general/IRC","tagline":"Providing open source software to the public free of charge","precis":"Founded in 1999, the Apache Software Foundation is home to over 180 projects and countless contributors","description":"The Apache Software Foundation provides organizational, legal, and financial support for a broad range of open source software projects.

This is a long-term aspiration for Oppia, the tool which allows users to collaboratively create interactive tutorial experiences online.\n\n# Interactive learning\nOppia teaches content in small units called _explorations_. _Learners_ (users who visit Oppia to learn something) explore a new topic through an exploration. Explorations are dynamic and interactive, meaning there are multiple paths through the exploration depending on the answers the learner submits (similar to video games). Different answers result in Oppia responding differently. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach.\n\nA user may repeatedly struggle on a certain question. Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor; an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make.\n\n# Community-driven content creation\nThe other half of Oppia is a community of _creators_ (users who create explorations). Oppia offers tools for creating new explorations with the goal of allowing anyone to teach just about anything. Creating explorations is very much like creating a video game, and we face some similar challenges. Our exploration editor needs to help creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, or facilitate easily creating targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners).

This means that Scala grows with you. At the root, the language’s scalability is the result of a careful integration of object-oriented and functional language concepts.\n\nScala is the preferred workhorse language for many mission critical server systems. The generated code is on a par with Java’s and its precise typing means that many problems are caught at compile-time rather than after deployment.\n\n# Object-Oriented\nScala is a pure-bred object-oriented language. Conceptually, every value is an object and every operation is a method-call. The language supports advanced component architectures through classes and traits.\n\n# Functional\nEven though its syntax is fairly conventional, Scala is also a full-blown functional language. It has everything you would expect, including first-class functions, a library with efficient immutable data structures, and a general preference of immutability over mutation.\n\n# Seamless Java Interop\nScala runs on the JVM. Java and Scala classes can be freely mixed, no matter whether they reside in different projects or in the same. They can even mutually refer to each other, the Scala compiler contains a subset of a Java compiler to make sense of such recursive dependencies.\n\n# Fun\nMaybe most important is that programming in Scala tends to be very enjoyable. No boilerplate, rapid iteration, but at the same time the safety of a strong static type system.

The HEP Software Foundation (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing. \n\nCERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, http://www.cern.ch) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as CERN-SFT group that provides common software for CERN's experiments. This year the program has expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator  http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments have announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: detector and accelerator simulation (Falcon, Geant4, GeantV, Pythia, SixTrack), data analysis (ROOT, TMVA, scikit-HEP, Go-HEP), event reconstruction (CMS Tracking), data management (transfer2go) and many others.

The project targets applications, intended to run on GPU, that involve many dynamic data structures with many small allocations and deallocations. We want to design and implement a scheme for dynamically allocating memory for data structures (eg. vector of vector) on demand. The allocator on GPU will allocate a pre-defined amount of memory at a time. The design will try to use this predefined size of memory to service the upcoming requests for a smaller amount of memory from this larger pool. This way the service of memory allocation will be fast as the allocation is already done. The allocator will also handle the resize as per demand. We will see how the implementation handles the challenges posed by the GPU  for allocating as per demand.","assignee_display_names":["Andrea Bocci","Vincenzo Innocente","Felice Pantaleo","Marco Rovere"],"program_year":2017},{"id":5565023555420160,"title":"Smart Range Viewer","subcategory":"visualization","organization":{"id":6325608897314816,"name":"Green Navigation","slug":"green-navigation","website_url":"http://greennav.io","category":"other","contact_email":"greennav@googlegroups.com","mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/d/forum/greennav","irc_channel":"http://grennavigation.slack.com","tagline":"Energy efficient routing for electric vehicles","precis":"Green Navigation (abbreviated as GreenNav) provides driving directions for electric vehicles and predicts their cruising range","description":"# What is GreenNav\n\nGreen Navigation (abbreviated as GreenNav) provides driving directions for electric vehicles and predicts their cruising range.

Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.\n\nThere are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Perforce and Subversion servers for experimental and third party development.

We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.\n\nIn addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, OpenBSM and OpenPAM.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 2-Clause \"Simplified\" or \"FreeBSD\" License (BSD-2-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/IOF3ntTux8ygtELyAg8zgG0Qh_0LgxqoFHNQiRapAGYdfLNPM3VLdZpdT2MtowkKK28PlljbJfbE6fr_2WBHMhzUX5o0eao","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/freebsd","blog_url":"https://planet.FreeBSD.org/","application_instructions":"Instructions for applications including a template can be found at https://www.FreeBSD.org/projects/summerofcode.html \n\nStudents should have familiarity with UNIX/Linux/FreeBSD, and should have experience with installing and re-building FreeBSD should their project require this.

Mobile robots that encounter people on a regular basis must react to them in some way or the other. Traditional robot control algorithms for path planning and obstacle avoidance treat all sensor readings identically, as foreign objects that must be avoided. However, for a mobile robot that operates around people, these traditional algorithms may not follow the social norms. Even simple conventions like move to the right when a person is encountered might not be honored by these algorithms. However, people would want to, or rather tend to perceive robots-particularly assistive robots, as human like.

While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.\n\nThough the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution & skills.\n\nThe community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations.

It includes\n\n- an effective data handling and storage facility,\n- a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,\n- a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,\n- graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and\n- a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.\n\nThe term “environment” is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.\n\nR, like S, is designed around a true computer language, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time.

This is tragic, for today we know that the ancient world – from Rome to Mesopotamia to India to China – consisted of deeply interconnected networks of ideas, technologies, art, and beliefs.\n\nWe have developed the Classical Language Toolkit (CLTK) because we believe it will revolutionize the study of the ancient world. It will do so by removing barriers to entry for those doing natural language processing (NLP) in Classical languages (namely, the surviving literature of the entirety of Eurasia and north Africa, from roughly 3000 B.C. to A.D. 1500). As a framework for multidisciplinary research, the CLTK will help scholars of tomorrow discover the shared origins of what were once thought disparate cultures.\n\nAs software, the CLTK is a suite of NLP tools suited to the special needs of ancient languages. We have have three goals: The most basic is to offer low-level libraries for doing NLP in particular Classical languages (e.g., Ancient Greek, Sanskrit). Developed with an extensible architecture, our code is easily hacked to support new languages. Second, the CLTK offers tools for students and scholars to do reproducible scientific research. For instance, it has version–controlled linguistic corpora and a suite of functions for stylometrics. Third, it is a framework for multidisciplinary language research. With pre–trained models (such as Word2Vec for vector space models, Moses for machine translation, and LDA for topic modeling), we now provide (or will soon) easy–to–use tools to capture the transmission and evolution of knowledge, from the earliest human societies to the dawn of the modern era.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"MIT license (MIT)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/mPW7xNGfV6zRQW74cTVBmxeKKwM0no6K1Pr9Gw-VTffk_O15Dl2_41xoExM0e_v54pRBJKE99eQ6A1XRv9DmngX8R4f9i24","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/diyclassics","blog_url":"http://cltk.org/blog","application_instructions":"See our [Project ideas page](https://github.com/cltk/cltk/wiki/Project-ideas#gsoc-projects) for a list of GSOC tasks that are suited to three months' work for a beginning–to–intermediate programmer or language student.

It quickly became and remains one of the most important reference databases in genomics, following the rapid development of the field. Its initial mission included finding all of the genes in the human genome. A year later, the mouse genome was published and we developed tools to directly compare genomes across species. Over the following decade, sequencing capacity increased exponentially (faster that Moore's Law in fact) and large surveys started examining more species and more individuals within each species. Our mission therefore expanded to store these datasets and statistics efficiently. Finally, in recent years, sequencing has been used to study the biochemical activity of the DNA molecule within the different tissues of an individual, prompting us to extend yet again our remit.\n\nAt the same time, Ensembl is an evolving software development project. Over 15 years, we moved from a central relational MySQL database with a Perl API and static web pages, to an array of storage technologies with a RESTful interface and an interactive front-end. We have dedicated portals for the large clades on the tree of life (known as Ensembl Genomes). Our annotations are produced through centuries of CPU time, coordinated by our powerful eHive analysis workflow manager.\n\nToday, we are a team of nearly 60 full time staff, housed at the European Bioinformatics Institute, and we collaborate with many external contributors around the world, in particular via our Github repositories where you can see us work day-to-day.

PDF.js current uses xhr for networking to fetch data, but it is inefficient in terms of memory as it has to buffer all the response. As xhr is an ever growing buffer, it stores all the data in its internal buffer, this uses lots of memory. Using Streams API, we can use the response incrementally and pass it for parsing and rendering as soon as it is received, hence there is no need to buffer the whole response. For rendering purpose, PDF.js makes chunks of data by parsing pdf commands in worker thread. After chunking the whole data, it is passed to the main thread for painting. Buffering the entire data in the worker thread uses a huge amount memory, and main thread also has to wait for the entire data to be parsed. This creates inefficiency in terms of memory and speed. Using Streams API, we can send the chunks from worker thread to main thread as soon as they are created, reducing the memory usage and increases speed.

The more powerful type system\nis not just a bug-finding tool:  it is a verification tool that gives\na guarantee that no errors (of certain types) exist in your program.\nEven though it is powerful, it is easy to use.  It follows the\nstandard typing rules that programmers already know, and it fits into\ntheir workflow.  We have created around 20 [new type\nsystems](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#introduction), and other\npeople have created [many\nmore](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#third-party-checkers).\n\nThe Checker Framework is popular:  it is successfully used on hundreds\nof projects at Google, on Wall Street, and in other companies from big\nto small.  It it attractive to programmers who care about their craft\nand the quality of their code.  The Checker Framework is the\nmotivation for Java's type annotations feature.  Talks on it have\nreceived multiple awards at conferences such as JavaOne.  With this\nwidespread use, there is a need for people to help with the project:\neverything from bug fixes, to new features, to case studies, to IDE\nintegration.  We welcome your contribution!\n\nPlease see our [ideas list](https://checkerframework.org/gsoc-2017-ideas.html) for [how to get started](https://checkerframework.org/gsoc-2017-ideas.html#get-started).","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"MIT license (MIT)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/GZt2-5AlJv9iEpwGkNRDL1cLb6ejHDluSzSp8KEKj_eL0fvVJPukXU8Vw1K_s606n2BdzNUVedgkUu3xet5oTIB7D7oWBwY","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":"http://programanalysis.blogspot.com/","application_instructions":"Why should you join this project?

The goal of Gentoo is to design tools and systems that allow a user to do that work as pleasantly and efficiently as possible, as they see fit. Our tools should be a joy to use, and should help the user to appreciate the richness of the Linux and free software community, and the flexibility of free software. This is only possible when the tool is designed to reflect and transmit the will of the user, and leave the possibilities open as to the final form of the raw materials (the source code.) If the tool forces the user to do things a particular way, then the tool is working against, rather than for, the user. We have all experienced situations where tools seem to be imposing their respective wills on us. This is backwards, and contrary to the Gentoo philosophy.\n\nPut another way, the Gentoo philosophy is to create better tools. When a tool is doing its job perfectly, you might not even be very aware of its presence, because it does not interfere and make its presence known, nor does it force you to interact with it when you don’t want it to. The tool serves the user rather than the user serving the tool.\n\nThe goal of Gentoo is to strive to create near-ideal tools. Tools that can accommodate the needs of many different users all with divergent goals. Don’t you love it when you find a tool that does exactly what you want to do? Doesn’t it feel great?

The human visual, acting like a low-pass filter, blurs these printed and not printed dots together to create the illusion of continuous shades of gray. Typical halftoning algorithms produce bitmaps as output. However, there are cases when scalable halftone patterns would be useful. \n\nScalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation and thus obvious choice for scalable graphics. The project aims to create SVG equivalents of standard halftone patterns. These would allow a lower resolution grayscale image to be approximated by an infinite resolution monochrome vector image.","assignee_display_names":["Bart Massey"],"program_year":2017},{"id":6355574764601344,"title":"SWIM algorithm for Group Membership and Quorum model (GeoMetric/GridQuorum)","subcategory":"from ideas list","organization":{"id":5416945173135360,"name":"Apache Software Foundation","slug":"apache-software-foundation","website_url":"http://www.apache.org","category":"other","contact_email":"dev@community.apache.org","mailing_list":"http://apache.org/foundation/mailinglists.html","irc_channel":"https://wiki.apache.org/general/IRC","tagline":"Providing open source software to the public free of charge","precis":"Founded in 1999, the Apache Software Foundation is home to over 180 projects and countless contributors","description":"The Apache Software Foundation provides organizational, legal, and financial support for a broad range of open source software projects.

SymPy's current integrator module does a pretty good job in computing whatever is thrown at it. The main algorithm used in SymPy for symbolic integration is the Risch algorithm, though there are others as well like Risch-Norman algorithm, table look up etc., The aim of my project is to complete the transcendental function integration of Risch algorithm that includes completing Chetna's work done in GSoC 2013 on transcendental functions integration, and tying the loose end of previous year's GSoC. After that we will work on integration of algebraic functions. If we could integrate even just purely algebraic integrals, that would be huge for SymPy. Algebraic integrals are currently the hardest for the currently implemented algorithms.","assignee_display_names":["Kalevi Suominen","Aaron Meurer"],"program_year":2017},{"id":6152137391210496,"title":"Systers Features for Mailman 3","subcategory":"","organization":{"id":5368506909458432,"name":"Systers, an Anita Borg Institute community","slug":"systers-an-anita-borg-institute-community","website_url":"http://systers.org","category":"other","contact_email":"gsoc-admins@anitaborg.org","mailing_list":"http://systers.org/mailman/listinfo/systers-dev","irc_channel":"http://systers.io/slack-systers-opensource/","tagline":"Helping women find their potential in code.","precis":"Increasing the number of women in computing fields and technology.","description":"Systers is a community for all women involved in the technical aspects of computing.
