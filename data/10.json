        "description": "FreeBSD is an advanced operating system for modern server, desktop, and embedded computer platforms. FreeBSD provides advanced networking, impressive security features, and world class performance, and is used by some of the world's busiest web sites and most prevalent embedded networking and storage devices. From providing the foundation of the PlayStation 4 operating system, to Juniper's routers making up the backbone of the Internet, to being at the core of Apple's OSX and powering the servers Netflix use to stream terabits of video every second, chances are you are using FreeBSD right now without even realising it.\n\nThe FreeBSD Project began over 20 years ago in 1993, but is based on the work of Berkeley CSRG with a history going back to 1978. Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.\n\nThere are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Perforce and Subversion servers for experimental and third party development. This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.\n\nIn addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, OpenBSM and OpenPAM.",

For the start of the GSoC students should ideally know how to use some Version Control System like subversion or github.\n\nMost candidates keep some contact with the community, usually through project mailing lists or IRC, and actively keep in touch with developers to suggest possible mentors.\n\nPlease check the list of project ideas at https://wiki.FreeBSD.org/SummerOfCodeIdeas",

To improve the framework for CNNs for 2D detection, I mainly focus on two key tasks that remain to be addressed.  The first one is to implement OD interface for training and testing neural network architectures with CNN and RNN. The second is to add several recognition/detection algorithms to OpenDetection. To this end, I decompose each task into several small tasks and propose my solutions respectively, aiming to perfect the project in an elegant way. I also create milestones for each small tasks. I can work on this project full-time during this summer and I’ve equipped myself with prior knowledge and programing experiences in object detection and deep learning, which makes me competent to this project.",

      "abstract": "Cytoscape is an open source software platform for visualizing molecular interaction networks and biological pathways. It integrates these networks with annotations, gene expression profiles and other state data. Visualizing a complex network requires a great deal of calculations, thus takes a long time to render large networks with original software-based engine. This project aims to replace the original Cytoscape-2D engine with one taking advantage of high speed GPU calculation and delivering much better efficiency.\nThe proposed project’s goal is to build an optimized renderer that works faster with rendering a large network, has the ability to draw more nodes and can be displayed better on high-resolution screens based on previous work. Additionally, as the low level of Cytoscape System, the new renderer should be compatible with the system while easy to maintain and test.",

        "description": "In the summer of 2008 the [Metropolitan City of Rome](http://www.cittametropolitanaroma.gov.it/) decided to start a **free of charge and public Wi-Fi network** to be spread over its 5352 SQ KM territory including Rome and 120 other cities for a total of about 4.5 million inhabitants. The main objective of the project, called **ProvinciaWiFi** (later renamed [WiFi Metropolitano](http://www.cittametropolitanaroma.gov.it/index.php/wifimetropolitano-english-version)), was to take a decisive step to reduce the existing **digital divide** by fostering and facilitating the use of ICT by citizens.\nFrom the outset it was decided to commit the project to a completely open philosophy. For this reason a clear choice towards open software and operating systems and the availability of every modification, update and improvement to the community was made. The same approach was adopted for the knowledge and the experience acquired within the project. In order to pursue this goals the Province of Rome called the university consortium *CASPUR* (later merged in the [CINECA](https://www.cineca.it/en) consortium) to develop the technical solution. In this context, a research project conducted by the *CINECA* consortium found its perfect application. This project proposed an innovative methodology for the distribution of networks (more precisely Virtual LANs used for Wi-Fi connectivity) between geographically distant sites. \n\nThe methodology adopted made it possible to host public connectivity services on non-dedicated network infrastructures (e.g.: private xDSL) that for technical and legal reasons could not be used as such.  This is not the sole advantage that OpenWISP gave to *WiFi Metropolitano*: embracing the resource-sharing philosophy – typical of open projects – anyone can contribute to the network expansion simply by hosting an access point.\n\n The software tools and the architectures, including the OpenWISP 2 [wifi controller](http://openwisp.org/whatis.html#wifi-controller) and different [NetJSON](http://netjson.org/) implementations used in OpenWISP,  are released to the public free of charge under open-source licenses, we hope this will allow a broader audience to benefit from this work and improve upon it.",

Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nMany users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.",

This project seeks to extend mlr's capability in this regard, by developing an API that gives more flexibility to the user, and by providing access to a wider range of preprocessing methods. The proposed project would introduce a first-class `TaskTransformer` object that represents a particular data transformation procedure, and which can be organized in pipelines using a composition operator. Many `TaskTransformer` classes implementing the most popular and widely used preprocessing methods would be implemented.",

        "description": "CERN-HSF (High Energy Physics Software Foundation) is the umbrella organization for high-energy physics-related projects in GSoC. The HEP Software Foundation (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing. \n\nCERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, http://www.cern.ch) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as CERN-SFT group that provides common software for CERN's experiments. This year the program has expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator  http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments have announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: detector and accelerator simulation (Falcon, Geant4, GeantV, Pythia, SixTrack), data analysis (ROOT, TMVA, scikit-HEP, Go-HEP), event reconstruction (CMS Tracking), data management (transfer2go) and many others. We look forward to your contributions!",

The so-called “forward problem” that is the problem of solving differential equations for given parameter values in the differential equation models has been extensively studied by mathematicians, physicists, and engineers. However, the “inverse problem”, the problem of parameter estimation based on the measurements of output variables, has not been well explored using modern optimization and statistical methods. Parameter estimation aims to find the unknown parameters of the model which give the best fit to a set of experimental data. In this way, parameters which cannot be measured directly will be determined in order to ensure the best fit of the model with the experimental results. This will be done by globally minimizing an objective function which measures the quality of the fit. This inverse problem usually considers a cost function to be optimized (such as maximum likelihood). This problem has applications in systems biology, HIV-AIDS study.",

JPF is a highly extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification tools ranging from concurrency software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2017 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center,  Amazon Web Services, University of Texas at Austin, University of Texas at Dallas, Brigham Young University and the universities of London UK, Toronto CA, Tokyo JP, Basel CH, São Paulo BR, and Prague CZ.\n\nJPF is designed to be extensible. There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.\n\nJPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android. JPF is constantly being extended with support for verification of new types of properties and for new types of application domains.",

The HEP Software Foundation (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing. \n\nCERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, http://www.cern.ch) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as CERN-SFT group that provides common software for CERN's experiments. This year the program has expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator  http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments have announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: detector and accelerator simulation (Falcon, Geant4, GeantV, Pythia, SixTrack), data analysis (ROOT, TMVA, scikit-HEP, Go-HEP), event reconstruction (CMS Tracking), data management (transfer2go) and many others.

      "abstract": "Memory access is one of the most important operation done in modern processors thus it plays an important role in implementation of trusted execution environment. Recent secure processors and trusted environment encrypt memory contents to protect those important memory operations. However, sometimes just encrypting data is not enough since there are intelligent attackers who can see where the memory access goes to and infer where the real important data lies in. Those important data includes the private data, key, or OS fingerprint and else. These kind of attacks lead to concept of “memory obliviousness” to secure memory address itself. ORAM refers to Oblivious memory which can leverage obliviousness using specialized data structures and obfuscate memory access so even an attacker see or probe the memory access itself, he never learns about where important data lies on or even where the memory requests are headed to. Initially proposed by Goldreich and Ostrovsky, ORAM obfuscates memory access using random permutation, shuffling and encryption of contents. In this proposal, I’ll implement ORAM interface to support obliviousness on RISC-V’s trusted execution environment.",

These developments will be useful and interesting to electronic musicians interested in visual art, visual artists interested in electronic music, sound artists, and any other potential user of Processing. These developments are inline with the vision of the tool, as they will add features without distracting from its definition as a “flexible software sketchbook”.",

        "description": "The Processing Foundation was founded in 2012 after more than a decade of work with the original Processing software. The Foundation’s mission is to promote software literacy within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology-related fields — and to make these fields accessible to diverse communities. Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.\n\nWe do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes [Processing (Java)](http://processing.org), [p5.js (JavaScript)](http://p5js.org), and [Processing.py (Python)](http://py.processing.org/), and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.\n\nThe Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or ability. We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.\n\nAt our core is the philosophy and politics of open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skillset, but is instead a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. We believe software literacy and an understanding of media of all kinds is essential knowledge for today.",

We accept proposals for projects related to core development as well as libraries / add-ons for Processing, Processing for\nAndroid, p5.js, and Python Mode. The first thing you should do is read over the [Project List wiki page on github](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Project-List). There you'll find links to all of the relevant github repositories as well as lists of topics and projects for which we are actively seeking help. If you have questions about an idea or need guidance on forming your proposal, please post to the [Processing Forum](https://forum.processing.org/two/categories/summer-of-code-2017). \n\nFor GSoC, we actively seek help with features we know we need, but also look to applicants to propose ideas we haven't thought of ourselves. If you have an idea for a new feature for any of our environments, it's generally preferable to propose it as a library or mode so that it can be developed and tested as a standalone project. For all of our projects, it's incredibly important that things are kept as simple and user-friendly as possible. Our work is not for developers. It's for people who are less familiar with code, and/or just want to get things done. We're far less interested in features to make the environments more powerful for advanced users than we are in features that make it easier to handle tasks that are common for a wide range of our audience. \n\nYou should feel free to propose your idea however you see fit. If you are looking for guidance, [here is a proposal template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wfUEHHays75qol4PXNUZG4C4H8Aw36mVdSo9N2gkRUg/edit? usp=sharing).",

        "description": "mlpack is a C++ machine learning library with emphasis on scalability, speed, and ease-of-use. Its aim is to make machine learning possible for novice users by means of a simple, consistent API, while simultaneously exploiting C++ language features to provide maximum performance and maximum flexibility for expert users. This is done by providing a set of command-line executables which can be used as black boxes, and a modular C++ API for expert users and researchers to easily make changes to the internals of the algorithms.\n\nAs a result of this approach, mlpack outperforms competing machine learning libraries by large margins; the handful of publications relating to mlpack demonstrate this.\n\nmlpack is developed by contributors from around the world. It is released free of charge, under the 3-clause BSD License. (Versions older than 1.0.12 were released under the GNU Lesser General Public License: LGPL, version 3.)\n\nmlpack bindings for R are provided by the RcppMLPACK project.",

While young among programming languages, at just over five years since its public release, it's rapidly gaining momentum. The community of around 150,000 users (and growing) have together built over 1300 packages (and counting). Scientists and engineers in particular are excited about Julia's ability to move ideas rapidly from prototype to production, with a flexible and interactive workflow that doesn't compromise on performance. You can learn more about Julia’s features at http://julialang.org/.\n\nCompared to more established languages, Julia's package library is small and still coming of age – but for you, that's a great opportunity! Joining us for Google Summer of Code is a great way not only to build the packages and features you've always wanted and learn about something new, but also for those contributions to become core parts of Julia's ecosystem and used by many thousands of people. The scope of possible work is endless, but could include areas as diverse as developing the web stack, improving data munging facilities, hacking the compiler, or building packages for areas as life sciences, finance, physics, data science, machine learning, or something completely different!

It is dedicated to research on programming languages, with emphasis on the Lua language and reactive programming. It was founded on May 2004 by Prof. Roberto Ierusalimschy, the chief architect of the Lua language.\n\nLabLua consists of people from a wide range of backgrounds, including PhD candidates, professors and alumni who are the developers and maintainers of projects that are used by the Lua community at large.\n \n## What is Lua?\n[Lua](http://www.lua.org/) is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language. It supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, data-driven programming, and data description.\n\nLua has been used in many industrial applications (e.g., Adobe's Photoshop Lightroom), with an emphasis on embedded systems (e.g., the Ginga middleware for digital TV in Brazil) and games (e.g., World of Warcraft and Angry Birds). Several versions of Lua have been released and used in real applications since its creation in 1993.\n\n## What is Céu?\n[Céu](http://www.ceu-lang.org/) provides \"Structured Synchronous Reactive Programming\", a safe and deterministic concurrency model with side effects. Reactive applications interact continuously with the environment and are mostly guided through input events from it.  Céu can be described as a reactive, imperative, concurrent, synchronous, and deterministic language, which easily integrates with C and Lua.",

        "description": "Our world continues to be ravaged by a pandemic of epic proportions, as over 40 million people are infected with or dying from HIV/AIDS -- most (up to 95%) are in developing countries. Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (http://regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (http://pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in dozens of developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and India.",

These services are distributed and scalable to accommodate very complex system configurations and performance problems.\n\nPCP supports many different platforms, including (but not limited to) Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris and Windows.  From a high-level PCP can be considered to contain two classes of software utility:\n\n###### PCP Collectors\nThese are the parts of PCP that collect and extract performance data from various sources, e.g. the operating system kernel.\n\n###### PCP Monitors\nThese are the parts of PCP that display data collected from hosts (or archives) that have the PCP Collector installed.  Many monitor tools are available as part of the core PCP release, while other (typically graphical) monitoring tools are available separately in the PCP GUI or PCP WebApp packages.\n\nThe PCP architecture is distributed in the sense that any PCP tool may be  executing remotely.  On  the host (or hosts) being monitored, each domain of performance metrics, whether the kernel, a service layer, a database management system, a web server, an application, etc. requires a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which is responsible for collecting performance measurements from that domain.  All PMDAs are controlled by the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon (PMCD) on the same host.\n\nClient applications (the monitoring tools) connect to PMCD, which acts as a router for requests, by forwarding requests to the appropriate PMDA and returning the responses to the clients.  Clients may also access performance data from a PCP archive for retrospective analysis.",

So far,  it has **received contributions of [200+ student developers](https://teammatesv4.appspot.com/about.jsp)** and have done **more than 200 [releases](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/milestones?direction=desc&sort=due_date&state=closed)** over a six year period. \nBecause one of the main aims of TEAMMATES (the project) is to train students in contributing to non-trivial OSS productions system, it is well-designed, well-documented, and well-tested (we have a very high level of automated testing).The product uses several emerging technologies (e.g., Google App Engine) learning of which will benefit students. Because TEAMMATES (the product) is a software for students by students, students can relate to the problem domain better. The scale of the system is big enough (~150 KLoC) without being overwhelming. \n\nProject led by faculty member [Damith C. Rajapakse](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~damithch)  and his team.\nProduct website: [http://teammatesOnline.info](http://teammatesOnline.info)",

        "description": "NumFOCUS supports and promotes world-class, innovative, open source scientific software. Most individual projects, even the wildly successful ones, find the overhead of a non-profit to be too large for their community to bear. NumFOCUS provides a critical service as an umbrella organization for these projects.\n\nThe following projects will be participating under the NumFOCUS umbrella:\n- [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.github.io/) - A community led collection of recipes for the conda package manager. \n- [Data Retriever](http://www.data-retriever.org) - The Data Retriever is a package manager for data. It downloads, cleans, and stores publicly available data, so that analysts spend less time cleaning and managing data, and more time analyzing it. \n- [FEniCS Project](https://fenicsproject.org/) -  The FEniCS Project is a collection of tools with extensive features for the automated and efficient solution of differential equations. Partial differential equations can be specified in near-mathematical notation (as finite element variational problems) and solved automatically.\n- [Gensim](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim) - Gensim is an open-source Python library for topic modelling, document indexing and similarity retrieval with large corpora.\n- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.\n- [MDAnalysis](http://mdanalysis.org/) - MDAnalysis is an object-oriented python toolkit to analyze molecular dynamics trajectories generated by CHARMM, Gromacs, Amber, NAMD, or LAMMPS.\n- [nteract](https://nteract.io/) - nteract allows users to edit and share interactive notebook documents that contain explanatory text, executive code, and interactive visualizations.\n- [PyMC3](https://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc3/) - PyMC3 is a Python package for Bayesian statistical modeling and Probabilistic Machine Learning which focuses on advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo and variational fitting algorithms. \n- [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) - Stan is a probabilistic programming language for data analysis, enabling automatic inference for a large class of statistical models.\n\nVisit our [page](https://github.com/numfocus/gsoc) for more information.",

For such a huge amount of data (~  billions of  words), implementation needs to be reasonably fast, otherwise difference maybe in the order of days or even weeks of training time.\n\nFacebook Research recently released a new word embedding and classification library fastText, which performs better than word2vec on syntactic task, and trains much faster for supervised text classification. The architecture of supervised text classification is a modified version of word2vec cbow model, and  takes into account the n-gram features implemented using the hashing trick. The initial implementation by facebook was in C++, later @giacbrd produced a Python implementation (labeled word2vec) building on top of gensim code.\n\nTaking inspiration from gensim word2vec code optimization, this project aims at refactoring/ reorganizing, and re-implementing the frequently used and time consuming part in Cython to match the C++ (facebook’s fastText) performance.",

      "abstract": "# Photometric Calibration Tool Kit\nCamera calibration is always an important part of almost every vision applications. As the direct method of SLAM developed in recent years, **only geometry calibration is not enough**. Photometric calibration of a camera, which takes the camera response function, dense lens attenuation factors (vignetting effect) into account and recover the **irradiance images**, plays a key role in direct method SLAM. As I have tested on TUM Monocular Visual Odometry Dataset, camera pose tracking with photometric calibration has much smaller scale drift than without photometric calibration using Direct Sparse Odometry and LSD-SLAM. So I think it’s necessary to provide an **out-of-the-box tool kit** to photometrically calibrate users’ cameras.",

People should be able to walk up to any smart device - a vending machine, a poster, a toy, a bus stop, a rental car - and not have to download an app first. Everything should be just a tap away.\n\nThe number of smart devices is going to explode, and the assumption that each new device will require its own application just isn’t realistic. We need a system that lets anyone interact with any device at any time. The Physical Web isn’t about replacing native apps: it’s about enabling interaction when native apps just aren’t practical.\n\nThe Physical Web Project is the Google Summer of Code proposal for university students interested in developing applications around that technology. The Physical Web Project, while making use of Physical Web software, does not develop the Physical Web code-base itself. Physical Web is an open standard that everyone can use. By creating a common web standard that any device can use to offer interaction, a new range of services becomes possible. Instead, the Physical Web Project works on extending the Physical Web system with open source software enabling open source applications.",

The app will support combinations of text, images, audio and video - it will use Google Drive for its storage backend. The app will also allow the curators to create a map of the exhibition & beacons - also stored on Drive. \n\nOnce activated, the beacons will direct visitors to the URI of a webapp that we will also develop. The webapp will run on a server that connects to the Google Drive folder created by the Android app. This webapp, run on the museum’s servers, will use the map along with Web Bluetooth technology to learn the user’s location (by listing nearby beacons and their signal strength) and display to the user the content most relevant.",

What would modders come up with if you could create and ship a mod with a few simple commands, making it available immediately for download in-game by others, in a secure sandboxed environment?\n\n## Minimal Engine\n\nOur engine is intended to be as bare-bone as possible, even excluding such basics as inventory, health, creatures, or combat. A series of minimal modules are meant to be bundled with the game's standard distribution to offer a sort of vanilla game experience, with a focus on commonly used systems that are often fragmented and re-implemented many times over. All such modules are community owned and maintained, guaranteed to work with every release.\n\n## Extensibility\n\nAny content is wrapped in modules ranging from tiny frameworks supporting commonly needed utility to large gameplay templates commonly referred to as mod packs in the Minecraft world, that in turn can depend on dozens of the smaller pieces, maximizing reusability.\n\nCreating a new module is as easy as running a single gradlew command, having a community repository created on GitHub is another single request away, and fetching source for any such community module is yet another single command. Dependency resolution is supported within the engine framework both for development and for runtime usage, including auto-downloading from a running game server to connecting clients.",

      "abstract": "Currently, Terasology lacks a proper Physics-based combat system. Basic combat, based entirely on proximity and angles, can be simulated currently but creating a combat system that could use high velocity projectiles and reacts with environment much more dynamically(bouncing off surfaces) will be an important addition to the gameplay. The proposed project aims at restoring much of the functionality of old branch of the legacy combat system while also improving the Combat based AI for computer controlled characters. The project also aims at defining the characters in anatomical way with different body parts and susceptible to disease.",

Under the umbrella of the X.Org Foundation can be found Linux's DRM subsystem (10% of the size of Linux), Mesa (open source 3D and video-decoding acceleration for AMD, Intel, NVIDIA,...), and Wayland. X.org's technologies underpin much of today's computing environment, and expertise in it is in high demand worldwide.\n\nToday, as the result of more than 20 years of work by teams of leading open source developers, most of the graphical user interfaces for Unix and Linux systems rely on X.Org. On top of the X-Server-based systems, this includes Android- and ChromeOS-based devices, and Wayland-based systems (Sailfish OS, Gnome, ...). X.Org is responsible for the design of the X libraries which interface with application, the acceleration architectures used for graphics, and the graphics and input drivers. In particular, it has been at the center of the recent restructuring of the Linux graphics driver stack.\n\nCome help us make the future more open!",

      "abstract": "PiType is an already existing protein-protein interaction classifying tool created by my mentor.  It currently exists as both a web app and a standalone software package.  PiType is designed to classify proteins within a network into different categories: Mutually Exclusive (ME) vs Simultaneously Possible (SP) and Obligate (O) vs Non-Obligate (NO).  To do this, PiType takes a series of proteins within a network, analyses them to determine which of the above categories they fit into, and outputs that information as a table.  Because of the current input and output format, it is difficult for biologists to analyze and interpret the data. Cytoscape is open source software that provides numerous modules for studying and visualizing protein networks, and as such is the perfect tool to use for PiType. My project over the summer will thus be to create a Cytoscape plugin app using PiType’s already existent algorithms, to create a visualization tool that provides an intuitive interface for biologists.  By taking the base features of PiType, and implementing them as a Cytoscape plugin, my project will widen the number of potential users, and the utility of the app.",

        "description": "The Catrobat project develops useful frameworks to create games, animations, or apps easily within a short time. This set of creativity tools for smartphones, tablets, and browsers is inspired by the well-known Scratch framework by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab.\n\nThe motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.\n\nOur awarded Android app “Pocket Code” is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need of any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in a “Lego-like” style with blocks in just a few steps. Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special bricks for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro,...) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc.\n\nWe also work on frameworks for other OS and on making it available on browsers. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up to date to the current needs of the users. Motivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award, the Austrian National Innovation Award or the Re-Imagine Education Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org) our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions which will be released in the coming years. Over 400 developers already contributed to our project on different topics such as App-Development, Web-Technologies, Graphics, Usability, Internationalization, or Design.",

      "abstract": "KIO framework is used by KDE applications to provide file management abilities. This framework provides almost all file management functions that one will ever need. However it doesn’t provide any support for file management as a privileged user. So whenever there is a need to perform file management tasks with escalated privileges the application simply shows an error. A casual user may not see it as a problem but for power users, sysadmins, developers this is a huge impedance. Many users get around this by starting the whole application as root. Running Qt/KDE GUI solves the issue but its a very dangerous solution. Dangerous because if not handled properly it can cause irreversible damage to the the system. To address this issue some KDE applications are disabling being executed as root. For example, the next versions of Dolphin and Kate will show an error message and exit when started with root privileges.\n\nPolkit is just the tool which can solve this problem. It is the standard framework used by Linux desktops to grant privileged actions to unprivileged processes. The goal of this project is to add Polkit support in KIO and further integrate it in dolphin.",

The BeeWare Project aims to take the power of Python as a language, and use it to enable users of all skill levels to develop applications with native user interfaces; to do for mobile and desktop user-facing software the same thing that [Django](https://djangoproject.com) has done for web software. This means giving users a set of tools and libraries that enables them to develop rich, native user interfaces, and deploy them to their devices, including:\n\n* Tools to enable Python to run on different devices,\n* Tools to package a Python project so it can run on those devices,\n* Libraries to access the native capabilities of devices,\n* Tools to help develop, debug, and deploy these projects.\n\n# Python native\nIf Python isn't available as a first-class option on a platform, we'll do whatever is necessary to make Python available as a development language. And when we have the opportunity to embrace Python idiom for an API or a design, we're going to do just that. \n\n# Platform native\nIt's easy to use themes to achieve cross-platform. However, it's easy to spot apps that have been built using themes - they're the ones that don't behave quite like any other app. BeeWare uses native widgets and native functionality, rather than using a theme-based approach to application development. We also distribute our tools and libraries using platform-native distribution channels, such as app stores.\n\n# More than just code\nWe're not just about software, though. We also aim to be a project with a social conscience. We aim to develop and maintain a diverse and inclusive community, and we have a Code of Conduct that is rigorously enforced. We also aspire to develop a healthy and sustainable community - one that is aware of mental health issues of its participants, and provides the resources for people to start engaging, and continue to engage with the community.",

The main goal is the complete port of Cricket to use Toga as the framework for GUI interface. The base logic is mostly complete, so firstly I will plan how to adapt the actual architecture of the view to use Toga widgets. If I find one widget that Cricket uses but isn't implemented on Toga, I will develop a contribution to this specific widget. This way the application will not lose the basics layout. So, the proposal will not only focus on the port of Tkinter to Toga, but on mapping the necessary widgets for a real application using Toga framework. In addition of the advantages of using Toga instead of Tkinter as I highlighted, this is a opportunity to improve error handling and make better use of features that Toga has but Tkinter does not.

Drupal has great standard features, like easy content authoring, reliable performance, and excellent security. But what sets it apart is its flexibility; modularity is one of its core principles. Its tools help you build the versatile, structured content that dynamic web experiences need. It's also a great choice for creating integrated digital frameworks. You can extend it with any one, or many, of thousands of add-ons. Modules expand Drupal's functionality. Themes let you customize your content's presentation. Distributions are packaged Drupal bundles you can use as starter-kits. Mix and match these components to enhance Drupal's core abilities. Or, integrate Drupal with external services and other applications in your infrastructure. No other content management software is this powerful and scalable. The Drupal project is open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. It's distributed under the terms of the GNU (GPL). There are no licensing fees, ever. Drupal will always be free. The Drupal community is one of the largest open source communities in the world. We're more than 1,000,000 passionate developers, designers, trainers, strategists, coordinators, editors, and sponsors working together. We build Drupal, provide support, create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit pushes the Drupal project forward. New members are always welcome. Drupal 8 is the biggest update in Drupal's history. Creating content is easier. Every built-in theme is responsively designed. It's available in 100 languages, and its integration tools make it a great hub for complex ecosystems. More than 4,500 people, companies, and organizations contributed their time, experience, and imagination.",

Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nMany users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.",

        "description": "FreeBSD is an advanced operating system for modern server, desktop, and embedded computer platforms. FreeBSD provides advanced networking, impressive security features, and world class performance, and is used by some of the world's busiest web sites and most prevalent embedded networking and storage devices. From providing the foundation of the PlayStation 4 operating system, to Juniper's routers making up the backbone of the Internet, to being at the core of Apple's OSX and powering the servers Netflix use to stream terabits of video every second, chances are you are using FreeBSD right now without even realising it.\n\nThe FreeBSD Project began over 20 years ago in 1993, but is based on the work of Berkeley CSRG with a history going back to 1978. Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.\n\nThere are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Perforce and Subversion servers for experimental and third party development. This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.\n\nIn addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, OpenBSM and OpenPAM.",

The Linux counterpart of BSD iwm is called iwlwifi. It was developed by Intel and is distributed on a dual GPL/BSD license. The iwlwifi driver is the most advanced open source Intel driver I am aware of and it seems to support both 802.11ac and 802.11n. This is why Linux is going to be the main source tree I am going to work with later during the project.\n\nThe 802.11n parts I'll be improving are: NIC setup, antenna setup, channel setup, Rx and Tx of 11n/MIMO frames and Tx and Rx aggregation.

The purpose is only to replace the game executable, not to enhance or replace the game assets.\n\nScummVM is a collection of game engines for playing classic graphical point-and-click adventure games on modern hardware. Recently we have also started adding engines for RPG games.\n\nResidualVM is a sister project of ScummVM games and was created in 2003. ResidualVM shares large blocks of common code with ScummVM, some developers and even a mentor.\n\n- ScummVM supports classic 2D adventure games such as Monkey Island, Simon the Sorcerer, Space Quest, and many more. We have also started work to support 2D RPG games such as Dungeon Master. To this end, the Virtual Machines (called Engines) are complete reimplementations in C++ of the engines used in the original games. The number of engines is constantly growing thanks to a very agile and diversified development team and ScummVM is currently able to run more than 200 games. The VM approach followed by ScummVM results in efficient code, which has been ported to numerous Operating Systems (over 30). ScummVM has a highly productive team of about 45 currently active developers (out of an all-time pool of over 130), working together on a codebase of 2,800,000 lines of code. In addition ScummVM has many non-developer contributors, and a huge and highly active community.\n\n- ResidualVM is a cross-platform 3D game interpreter which allows you to play some 3D adventure games, such as Cyan's Myst 3 and LucasArts' Lua-based 3D adventures: Grim Fandango and Escape from Monkey Island, provided you already have their data files. Like ScummVM, ResidualVM replaces the executables shipped with the games, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed.",

Based on that, we will ask you a realistic planning for the 12 weeks of GSoC, including the deliverables expected at mid-term and at the end of the GSoC. In order to be complete, we also expect you to make a pull request, for example for a bug fix. The purpose is to ensure you know how to use Git, and that you had a look at our coding conventions.\n\nWe don't expect you to produce a perfect application without any help at all. We strongly encourage you to discuss your plans and your application with us while you're preparing it, to ensure your ideas align well with our own thoughts on the tasks, and that your objectives are achievable. It is also the perfect chance to already get to know your potential mentors and the rest of the team. Don't hesitate to join the IRC channels and ask questions: keep in mind that there are no stupid questions!\n\nIn order to help you structure your application, we summarized our requirements in a template: http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/GSoC_Application",

The (2) psycholinguists research the effect of cochlear implantation on child language acquisition. This description focuses on the (3) computational linguistics subgroup.\n\nCurrent research at CLiPS' Computational Linguistics Group focuses on developing tools that can extract data from social media messages, such as fine-grained sentiment analysis, and the detection of subversive behavior on social network sites (sexually transgressive behavior, hate speech, ...). Furthermore, CLiPS is well known for its work on computational stylometry and has developed state-of-the-art technology for authorship attribution, as well as author profiling, i.e. the detection of  personality, age and gender of the author of a text, based on personal writing style. Another line of research at CLiPS focuses on computational psycholinguistics and researches psychologically plausible models of child language acquisition and bilinguality. CLiPS also researches and develops tools for biomedical text mining.\n\nOver the years, CLiPS has established a strong reputation in the application of machine learning methods on a variety of language technology problems for a wide range of languages. To capitalize on this reputation, a spin-off company, Textgain (textgain.com), was founded in 2015 that aims to bring CLiPS technology to the market for commercial purposes.",

Missing unit tests must be added before moving on. Since porting *Python 2* code to *Python 3* code is a sort of standard problem for the Python community, there are many different tools available that can help in this regard.

It is dedicated to research on programming languages, with emphasis on the Lua language and reactive programming. It was founded on May 2004 by Prof. Roberto Ierusalimschy, the chief architect of the Lua language.\n\nLabLua consists of people from a wide range of backgrounds, including PhD candidates, professors and alumni who are the developers and maintainers of projects that are used by the Lua community at large.\n \n## What is Lua?\n[Lua](http://www.lua.org/) is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language. It supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, data-driven programming, and data description.\n\nLua has been used in many industrial applications (e.g., Adobe's Photoshop Lightroom), with an emphasis on embedded systems (e.g., the Ginga middleware for digital TV in Brazil) and games (e.g., World of Warcraft and Angry Birds). Several versions of Lua have been released and used in real applications since its creation in 1993.\n\n## What is Céu?\n[Céu](http://www.ceu-lang.org/) provides \"Structured Synchronous Reactive Programming\", a safe and deterministic concurrency model with side effects. Reactive applications interact continuously with the environment and are mostly guided through input events from it.  Céu can be described as a reactive, imperative, concurrent, synchronous, and deterministic language, which easily integrates with C and Lua.",

While numerous open source projects are utilized in Haiku, they are integrated seamlessly. This allows Haiku to achieve a level of consistency that provides many conveniences, and is truly enjoyable to use by both end-users and developers alike.\n\nWhat’s so good about Haiku anyway?\n==============================\n\nThe key highlights that distinguish Haiku from other operating systems include:\n\n- Specific focus on personal computing\n- Custom kernel designed for responsiveness\n- Fully threaded design for great efficiency with multi-processor/core CPUs\n- Rich OO API for faster development\n- Database-like file system (BFS) with support for indexed metadata\n- Unified, cohesive interface\n\nWhy Haiku?\n==========\n\nThe Be Operating System introduced progressive concepts and technologies that we believe represent the ideal means to simple and efficient personal computing. Haiku is the realization of those concepts and technologies in the form of an operating system that is open source and free.\n\nWho is behind Haiku?\n=================\n\nHaiku is developed by a growing community of volunteer developers from all around the world. Additionally, Haiku also exists thanks to the dedicated support of a fervent and friendly community, and that of Haiku, Inc., a non-profit organization founded by former project leader Michael Phipps with the purpose of supporting the development of Haiku as well as the growth of both the community and the Haiku platform.",

This could either be a [task marked easy](https://dev.haiku-os.org/query?status=assigned&status=new&status=reopened&summary=~easy), [TODO commented in code](http://xref.plausible.coop/source/search?q=TODO&defs=&refs=&path=&hist=&project=haiku), [Code style cleanup](https://www.haiku-os.org/development/coding-guidelines), fix for [PVS](http://pulkomandy.github.io) or [Coverity scan](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/haiku-32bit) issues, or any other unlisted task.\nSubmitting code that relates to your project will indicate a higher level of understanding and ability. The number and difficulty of resolved issues will be taken into consideration when evaluating your application. It is suggested to include the keyword \"gsoc2017\" on tickets that contain submissions, as this facilitates finding them in the future.\n\nWhy do you want a code contribution before I'm accepted?\n==============================================\n\nThis serves several purposes. It displays that you have the most basic skills that are required: building Haiku from source, running Haiku either natively or inside a VM, and using tools for online collaboration (bug tracker, mailing lists, IRC, etc.). More importantly, it provides our mentors with some insight into each individual student's motivation and abilities. It is an opportunity for you, the student to showcase yourself and to convince us that you are indeed the right person for the job.\n\nAdditional advice and hints\n=====================\n\nA more complete page is available on our website:\nhttps://www.haiku-os.org/community/gsoc/2017/students",

      "abstract": "Swift is a general purpose, multi-paradigm modern programming language which focuses on performance, safety and modern software design patterns aiming to be a C/C++ and Objective-C alternative. It was recently open-sourced by Apple and aims to make Swift portable with various OSes by leveraging LLVM for its compiler internals and POSIX for maintaining portability.  \n\nHaiku has support for other modern languages with similar technologies but it still misses out on being officially supported by them and as new releases come by, maintenance becomes very difficult as some use platform specific features.  With Swift 3.1's main focus on portability and with Haiku being partially POSIX compliant, this serves as a opportunity to add Haiku as a tier 1 platform for Swift and to potentially merge these changes upstream.",

Every user in the free wireless network provides his or her wireless LAN router for data transfer to other participants. In return, he or she can also transmit data, such as text, music and movies through a free internal network or use services setup by participants to chat, call or play online games. We use mesh networks.\n\nUmbrella Organisation\n-----\n\nWe act as umbrella organisation for other wireless communities like [Ninux](http://ninux.org), [qaul.net](http://qaul.net), [Guifi.net](http://guifi.net) or [WLAN Slovenija](https://wlan-si.net/) and communites developing software we extensivly use like [LEDE/OpenWRT](https://lede-project.org/), [OLSR](http://www.olsr.org/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page), [BATMAN](https://www.open-mesh.org/projects/open-mesh/wiki), [libremesh](http://libremesh.org/) or [retroshare](http://retroshare.sourceforge.net/).\n\nLocal communities provide software adapted to their own needs on their websites. There are more and more free wireless groups that meet regularly access in villages and cities.\n\nHardware and Software\n----\n\nMost devices in our networks are routers for home use. They should run with LEDE. In our local communities there are a lot of different approaches for different routing protocols, monitoring systems and map solutions. LEDE as OS for routers and OLSR, BATMAN and Babel as routing daemons are only a few examples of software developed together with freifunk.\nYou can find a great variety of topics where you can go on with wireless communities. We're looking for people working on new hardware drivers, improving routing protocols, developing network monitoring tools and user interface topics on the web interfaces, helping us with new features and tools to organize decentralized communities.\n\nCommon freifunk goals\n----\n\n* Educating and creating awareness on the subject of communication and freedom of information\n* Reducing the digital divide\n* Unhindered distribution of knowledge and resources\n* Empowering people to build and operate their own networks\n* Promote and support existing and new social structures\n\nAs we are decentralized there are some challenges, e.g. to get and show information about communities, working together with all those communties.",

The aim of the project is to provide various tools for electric vehicles. There are two sides to the project:\n\n## For Drivers\n\nOn one side, we want to provide drivers of electric vehicles with practical solutions, that is, with optimal driving direction for their route. For that we are developing a platform independent navigation system.\n\n## For Scientists\n\nOn the other side, we want to develop tools for scientifically analyzing algorithmic solutions. For that we are developing tools for visualization of algorithms, for comparing their performance, we want to provide a generic API for custom algorithms and a lot more.\n\n## Ideas\n\nInstead of working towards a specific electric vehicel, we want to leverage machine learning to derive the parameters automatically, getting better with every route.",

        "description": "Haiku is an open source operating system currently in development. Specifically targeting personal computing, Haiku is a fast, efficient, simple to use, easy to learn, and yet very powerful system for computer users of all levels. Additionally, Haiku offers something over other open source platforms which is quite unique: The project consists of a single team writing everything from the kernel, drivers, userland services, tool kit, and graphics stack to the included desktop applications and preflets. While numerous open source projects are utilized in Haiku, they are integrated seamlessly. This allows Haiku to achieve a level of consistency that provides many conveniences, and is truly enjoyable to use by both end-users and developers alike.\n\nWhat’s so good about Haiku anyway?\n==============================\n\nThe key highlights that distinguish Haiku from other operating systems include:\n\n- Specific focus on personal computing\n- Custom kernel designed for responsiveness\n- Fully threaded design for great efficiency with multi-processor/core CPUs\n- Rich OO API for faster development\n- Database-like file system (BFS) with support for indexed metadata\n- Unified, cohesive interface\n\nWhy Haiku?\n==========\n\nThe Be Operating System introduced progressive concepts and technologies that we believe represent the ideal means to simple and efficient personal computing. Haiku is the realization of those concepts and technologies in the form of an operating system that is open source and free.\n\nWho is behind Haiku?\n=================\n\nHaiku is developed by a growing community of volunteer developers from all around the world. Additionally, Haiku also exists thanks to the dedicated support of a fervent and friendly community, and that of Haiku, Inc., a non-profit organization founded by former project leader Michael Phipps with the purpose of supporting the development of Haiku as well as the growth of both the community and the Haiku platform.",

The number and difficulty of resolved issues will be taken into consideration when evaluating your application. It is suggested to include the keyword \"gsoc2017\" on tickets that contain submissions, as this facilitates finding them in the future.\n\nWhy do you want a code contribution before I'm accepted?\n==============================================\n\nThis serves several purposes. It displays that you have the most basic skills that are required: building Haiku from source, running Haiku either natively or inside a VM, and using tools for online collaboration (bug tracker, mailing lists, IRC, etc.). More importantly, it provides our mentors with some insight into each individual student's motivation and abilities. It is an opportunity for you, the student to showcase yourself and to convince us that you are indeed the right person for the job.\n\nAdditional advice and hints\n=====================\n\nA more complete page is available on our website:\nhttps://www.haiku-os.org/community/gsoc/2017/students",

If you want to follow a template, this one is a good starting point:\n\n**Introduction:** Your software project should solve a clearly defined problem. Before offering the solution (your Google Summer of Code project), you should first define the problem. What’s the current state of things? What’s the issue you wish to solve and why? This is somewhat like an elevator pitch.\n\n**Project goals:** This section should again be short and to the point, and it might be a good idea to format it like a list. You should propose a clear list of deliverables, explaining exactly what you promise to do and what you do not plan to do.\n\n**Implementation:** This section can be longer and more detailed. You should describe what you plan to do as a solution for the problem you defined earlier.\n\n**Timeline:** With the timeline you show that you understand the problem, that you have thought hard about a solution, and that you have also broken the solution down into manageable bits. A modest, realistic and detailed timeline is much better than a timeline that promises to move mountains.\n\n**About me:** Write a few lines about you.",

This can be tedious and impractical even for small number of attendees. The QR code in the ticket can really help in making the check-in process a lot more efficient.",

        "description": "Babel helps you write the latest version of JavaScript, and is helping shape the future of the language itself. It's used at Facebook, Google, Netflix, and hundreds of other [companies](http://babeljs.io/users). It's downloaded more than [6 million times a month](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-core) on npm.\n\nWhen your target browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE) don't support certain features natively, it helps you compile it down to a supported version.\n\nIn short, developers want to take advantage of the latest syntax in JavaScript before it's implemented in browsers, now. Because the version of JavaScript depends on the client's browser, we can't rely on the fact they are using an up to date browser.\n\n### Transition to Natively Support JavaScript\n\nBabel abstracts the browser away so that you can worry about writing your application rather than trying to figure out what features are supported in each one.\n\nFor example: if you support an older browser such as Internet Explorer 9, it won't have any of the features in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), so Babel will transform your code into ES5 which is supported.\n\n```js\n[1, 2, 3].map(n => n + 2); // arrow functions!\n```\n\n```js\n[1, 2, 3].map(function (a) { // compiled to a regular function expression\n  return a+2;\n});\n```\n\nEfforts like https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env means you can take advantage of the native browser support when possible.\n\nPlease read the tips below on how to get started and how to create a successful proposal!",

If you don't have experience with it, we strongly suggest using it in a project before applying, otherwise you won't understand the context behind the decisions we make (why does this project need to exist and continue to exist). I believe we would favor those with more experience with the tool itself (and understand it's issues) rather than someone that hasn't used it before but just knows about compliers\n- Any code change (other than maybe the website) will require extensive tests and documentation, so you'll need to know how to write unit tests as well as explain what you project is doing for the user\n- Have a Slack account (explained below) to communicate with the mentors/community\n\n## Before applying, you should\n- Read our guide: https://github.com/babel/babel/wiki/GSoC-Application-Guide\n- Join our [Slack](http://slack.babeljs.io/) and say hi in our [#summer-of-code](https://babeljs.slack.com/messages/summer-of-code) channel if you have questions!\n- Follow us on twitter: [@babeljs](https://twitter.com/babeljs)\n- Star/Watch our main github repo: https://github.com/babel/babel\n- Check out our [docs website](https://babeljs.io/) and play around with our [REPL](https://babeljs.io/repl/#?babili=false&evaluate=false&lineWrap=false&presets=env&targets=&browsers=&builtIns=true&code=var%20name%20%3D%20%22Bob%22%2C%20time%20%3D%20%22today%22%3B%0A%60Hello%20%24%7Bname%7D%2C%20how%20are%20you%20%24%7Btime%7D%3F%60&experimental=true&loose=true&spec=true&playground=false&stage=0)\n- Read through [babel-handbook](https://github.com/thejameskyle/babel-handbook/blob/master/translations/en/README.md)",

        "description": "The Java Pathfinder project (JPF) was initially conceived and developed at NASA Ames Research Center in 1999. JPF was open sourced in April 2005 as one of the first ongoing NASA development projects to date, and it is now released under the Apache license, 2.0. JPF is a highly extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification tools ranging from concurrency software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2017 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center,  Amazon Web Services, University of Texas at Austin, University of Texas at Dallas, Brigham Young University and the universities of London UK, Toronto CA, Tokyo JP, Basel CH, São Paulo BR, and Prague CZ.\n\nJPF is designed to be extensible. There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.\n\nJPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android. JPF is constantly being extended with support for verification of new types of properties and for new types of application domains.",

      "abstract": "The Symbolic Execution (SPF) extension for NASA’s Java Pathfinder (JPF) has been used to generate quality test cases by symbolically executing code and using the derived constraints to find test values which will follow each feasible program path.  \n\nA similar idea views the derived constraints as a partial specification of correct program behavior and uses this data to guide program repair.  This turns program repair into a search problem over the space of code snippets characterized by constraints derived via symbolic execution, the “semantic search” problem.  Previous work in this area was done exclusively with C programs, and the extension of this work to Java would be of major benefit for program repair research. \n\nFor GSoC, I propose to use SPF to empirically quantify the degree to which such an approach is possible using currently-existing open-source Java programs, create functionality-searchable database of Java code snippets, and use this with existing efforts for search-based program repair.",

It includes\n\n- an effective data handling and storage facility,\n- a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,\n- a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,\n- graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and\n- a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.\n\nThe term “environment” is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.\n\nR, like S, is designed around a true computer language, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nMany users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.",
