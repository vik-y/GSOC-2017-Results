JPF is a highly extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification tools ranging from concurrency software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2017 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center,  Amazon Web Services, University of Texas at Austin, University of Texas at Dallas, Brigham Young University and the universities of London UK, Toronto CA, Tokyo JP, Basel CH, São Paulo BR, and Prague CZ.\n\nJPF is designed to be extensible. There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.\n\nJPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android.

The underlying lazy initialization algorithm exhaustively enumerates all heap objects that can bind to the structured inputs accessed by the program. This enumeration may identify many invalid heap configurations that violate properties of the data structures in the heap, which leads to a huge amount of false alarms.\n\nWe aim to tackle this problem by using separation logic, a well-known assertion language designed for reasoning about heap-manipulating programs. We will build a system, Java StarFinder (JSF), that enables users to describe properties of the data structures in the heap using separation logic. JSF is a symbolic execution engine, built on top of SPF, that generates path conditions (PCs) in the form of separation logic. These PCs are checked by a solver for satisfiability and test input generation. In addition, JSF can verify program correctness by collecting PCs satisfying some given preconditions and verifying if these PCs satisfy user-provided assertions.","assignee_display_names":["Quoc Sang Phan","Quang Loc Le"],"program_year":2017},{"id":5323974757056512,"title":"Java StubParser 2.0","subcategory":"supporting tool","organization":{"id":4906659840262144,"name":"Checker Framework","slug":"checker-framework","website_url":"https://checkerframework.org/","category":"languages","contact_email":"checker-framework-dev@cs.washington.edu","mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/checker-framework-gsoc","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"Preventing programming errors before they happen, via easy-to-use verification","precis":"We build tools for programmers, to prevent run-time errors at compile time.

Pluggable type-checking replaces a\nprogramming language's built-in type system with a more powerful,\nexpressive one.\n\nJava's type system prevents some bugs, such as `int count =\n\"hello\";`.  However, it does not prevent other bugs, such as null\npointer dereferences, concurrency errors, disclosure of private\ninformation, incorrect internationalization, out-of-bounds indices, and\nso forth.\n\nThe Checker Framework enables you to create a more powerful type\nsystem and use it in place of Java's.  The more powerful type system\nis not just a bug-finding tool:  it is a verification tool that gives\na guarantee that no errors (of certain types) exist in your program.\nEven though it is powerful, it is easy to use.  It follows the\nstandard typing rules that programmers already know, and it fits into\ntheir workflow.  We have created around 20 [new type\nsystems](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#introduction), and other\npeople have created [many\nmore](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#third-party-checkers).\n\nThe Checker Framework is popular:  it is successfully used on hundreds\nof projects at Google, on Wall Street, and in other companies from big\nto small.  It it attractive to programmers who care about their craft\nand the quality of their code.  The Checker Framework is the\nmotivation for Java's type annotations feature.  Talks on it have\nreceived multiple awards at conferences such as JavaOne.  With this\nwidespread use, there is a need for people to help with the project:\neverything from bug fixes, to new features, to case studies, to IDE\nintegration.  We welcome your contribution!\n\nPlease see our [ideas list](https://checkerframework.org/gsoc-2017-ideas.html) for [how to get started](https://checkerframework.org/gsoc-2017-ideas.html#get-started).","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"MIT license (MIT)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/GZt2-5AlJv9iEpwGkNRDL1cLb6ejHDluSzSp8KEKj_eL0fvVJPukXU8Vw1K_s606n2BdzNUVedgkUu3xet5oTIB7D7oWBwY","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":"http://programanalysis.blogspot.com/","application_instructions":"Why should you join this project?

Monteiro","program_year":2017},"abstract":"The Checker Framework provides a collection of type systems to prevent bugs on Java programs at development time. It is based on the idea to replace the Java’s built-in type system with a more powerful and expressive one. Furthermore, Checker framework is easy to use and an user must follow three simple steps in order to verify a program: (i) select an appropriate type system (e.g., Interning Checker), (ii) annotate the program, and (iii) run the type-checker. In some cases, a program uses libraries that have no specifications (i.e., annotations), which could lead to extra warnings. In order to overcome such issue, one may use stub files to express such specifications. Checker framework provides a stub reader named Java StubParser, which is a modified version of the JavaParser tool. However, the current version of Java StubParser has several limitations regarding the most recent version of Java syntax (i.e., Java 6, 7, and 8 features). The main goal of this project is to develop a new version of Java StubParser that is compatible with Java 8 specifications. This could cause a huge impact in the Checker Framework project, once it will address several issues reported by developers.","assignee_display_names":["Michael Ernst"],"program_year":2017},{"id":4700599110074368,"title":"Javascript Backend for Gnu Guile","subcategory":"new features","organization":{"id":5029441722908672,"name":"The GNU Project","slug":"the-gnu-project","website_url":"http://www.gnu.org","category":"operating_systems","contact_email":null,"mailing_list":"https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/summer-of-code","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"GNU is an operating system that is free software","precis":"GNU is an operating system that is free software","description":"The GNU Project was launched in 1984 to develop a complete Unix-like operating system which is entirely free software: the GNU system.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ef_Y90L0lmDpYXgXxckBIA6gUqiyFw5fZolpyj6TQo4oZjIHYYLJVnaoIBnqeyvHQDmm-tQt9uwZg-q333ETUZhW8huboFk","image_bg_color":"ffffff","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"https://www.gnu.org/software/soc-projects/ideas.html","topic_tags":["operating system"],"technology_tags":["c","guile","python"],"proposal_tags":["new features","bug fixing"],"ideas_list":"https://www.gnu.org/software/soc-projects/ideas.html","contact_method":"https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/summer-of-code","program_year":2017},"student":{"id":6575857993777152,"display_name":"Ian-1","program_year":2017},"abstract":"To implement a Javascript backend to Gnu Guile, capable of compiling programs for execution in a modern web browser.

The HEP Software Foundation (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing. \n\nCERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, http://www.cern.ch) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as CERN-SFT group that provides common software for CERN's experiments. This year the program has expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator  http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments have announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: detector and accelerator simulation (Falcon, Geant4, GeantV, Pythia, SixTrack), data analysis (ROOT, TMVA, scikit-HEP, Go-HEP), event reconstruction (CMS Tracking), data management (transfer2go) and many others.

JPF was open sourced in April 2005 as one of the first ongoing NASA development projects to date, and it is now released under the Apache license, 2.0. JPF is a highly extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification tools ranging from concurrency software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2017 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center,  Amazon Web Services, University of Texas at Austin, University of Texas at Dallas, Brigham Young University and the universities of London UK, Toronto CA, Tokyo JP, Basel CH, São Paulo BR, and Prague CZ.\n\nJPF is designed to be extensible. There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.\n\nJPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android. JPF is constantly being extended with support for verification of new types of properties and for new types of application domains.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/bnseafUGkhHioi5kR6ZewNTKSQX2t9Sz7IEA0vAuY39pr9PeVCvPdg1hWGDEW6Z6sIOXuimh1jK4Nk7tu525zpwBtaY9Ass","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"JPF is written in Java, and it analyzes Java bytecode.

The BeeWare Project aims to take the power of Python as a language, and use it to enable users of all skill levels to develop applications with native user interfaces; to do for mobile and desktop user-facing software the same thing that [Django](https://djangoproject.com) has done for web software. This means giving users a set of tools and libraries that enables them to develop rich, native user interfaces, and deploy them to their devices, including:\n\n* Tools to enable Python to run on different devices,\n* Tools to package a Python project so it can run on those devices,\n* Libraries to access the native capabilities of devices,\n* Tools to help develop, debug, and deploy these projects.\n\n# Python native\nIf Python isn't available as a first-class option on a platform, we'll do whatever is necessary to make Python available as a development language. And when we have the opportunity to embrace Python idiom for an API or a design, we're going to do just that. \n\n# Platform native\nIt's easy to use themes to achieve cross-platform. However, it's easy to spot apps that have been built using themes - they're the ones that don't behave quite like any other app. BeeWare uses native widgets and native functionality, rather than using a theme-based approach to application development. We also distribute our tools and libraries using platform-native distribution channels, such as app stores.\n\n# More than just code\nWe're not just about software, though. We also aim to be a project with a social conscience. We aim to develop and maintain a diverse and inclusive community, and we have a Code of Conduct that is rigorously enforced. We also aspire to develop a healthy and sustainable community - one that is aware of mental health issues of its participants, and provides the resources for people to start engaging, and continue to engage with the community.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 3-Clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License (BSD-3-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/q9j-rVpc9hO-RcN0qJ4FxVm7RDZZVi_lCPT_Uy-7mjKjU5bjyLT1od7cz6ndebuHnL1BledS7Up-jUfP-FN-4RpQKbviqg","image_bg_color":"eceeef","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/pybeeware","blog_url":"http://pybee.org/news/","application_instructions":"To begin the application process, open a ticket on the appropriate repository on Github.

So far,  it has **received contributions of [200+ student developers](https://teammatesv4.appspot.com/about.jsp)** and have done **more than 200 [releases](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/milestones?direction=desc&sort=due_date&state=closed)** over a six year period. \nBecause one of the main aims of TEAMMATES (the project) is to train students in contributing to non-trivial OSS productions system, it is well-designed, well-documented, and well-tested (we have a very high level of automated testing).The product uses several emerging technologies (e.g., Google App Engine) learning of which will benefit students. Because TEAMMATES (the product) is a software for students by students, students can relate to the problem domain better. The scale of the system is big enough (~150 KLoC) without being overwhelming. \n\nProject led by faculty member [Damith C.

It includes\n\n- an effective data handling and storage facility,\n- a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,\n- a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,\n- graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and\n- a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.\n\nThe term “environment” is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.\n\nR, like S, is designed around a true computer language, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nMany users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/e6UifH3TR9p8a-8sKngoEkMHw_0yJ1ssFPNN1WH-gkUOHdRwf_qU-O5UVhN3co1AZzrI7atjqYKTtl6p-z6sKq65rRanTg","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":"http://www.r-bloggers.com/","application_instructions":"1. look for a project on\nhttps://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2017/wiki/table-of-proposed-coding-projects\n\n2.

Our tools should be a joy to use, and should help the user to appreciate the richness of the Linux and free software community, and the flexibility of free software. This is only possible when the tool is designed to reflect and transmit the will of the user, and leave the possibilities open as to the final form of the raw materials (the source code.) If the tool forces the user to do things a particular way, then the tool is working against, rather than for, the user. We have all experienced situations where tools seem to be imposing their respective wills on us. This is backwards, and contrary to the Gentoo philosophy.\n\nPut another way, the Gentoo philosophy is to create better tools. When a tool is doing its job perfectly, you might not even be very aware of its presence, because it does not interfere and make its presence known, nor does it force you to interact with it when you don’t want it to. The tool serves the user rather than the user serving the tool.\n\nThe goal of Gentoo is to strive to create near-ideal tools. Tools that can accommodate the needs of many different users all with divergent goals. Don’t you love it when you find a tool that does exactly what you want to do? Doesn’t it feel great?

It is interlinked to many other datasets. The knowledge in DBpedia is exposed through a technology stack called *Linked Data*, which has been revolutionizing the way applications interact with the Web: with Linked Data technologies, all APIs are interconnected via standard Web protocols and languages.\n\n# The Web of data\nSuch *Web of data* provides useful knowledge that can complement the *Web of documents* in many ways. See, for instance, how bloggers tag their posts or assign them to categories in order to organize and interconnect their blog posts. This is a very simple way to connect unstructured text to a structure (hierarchy of tags). For more advanced examples, see how **BBC** has created the *World Cup 2010 website* by interconnecting textual content and facts from their knowledge base.\n\nOr, more recently, did you see that **IBM's Watson used DBpedia data to win the Jeopardy challenge**?\n\n# DBpedia Spotlight\n\n**DBpedia Spotlight** is an open source text annotation tool that connects text to Linked Data by marking names of things in text (we call that *spotting*) and selecting between multiple interpretations of these names (we call that *disambiguation*). For example, `Washington` can be interpreted in more than 50 ways including a state, a government or a person.

The HEP Software Foundation (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing. \n\nCERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, http://www.cern.ch) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as CERN-SFT group that provides common software for CERN's experiments. This year the program has expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator  http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments have announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: detector and accelerator simulation (Falcon, Geant4, GeantV, Pythia, SixTrack), data analysis (ROOT, TMVA, scikit-HEP, Go-HEP), event reconstruction (CMS Tracking), data management (transfer2go) and many others.

The current speaker recognition system of the pipeline although fully functional, is not yet ready for processing news videos archived in the NewsScape. The main reason is lack of training data from relevant speakers to enroll into the system. Manually extracting such training data by human experts is inefficient, time-consuming or even infeasible at large scale. On the other hand, for a significant part of the archive (videos recorded over a decade since 2007), there are transcripts (the tpt files) that contain caption and speaker information saved along with the videos. These transcripts can potentially be used to automatically extract speaker training data, if they are accurately aligned with the audios. Therefore, the core idea of this proposal is to establish a workflow in the current audio pipeline from Gentle alignment to accurate timestamps of speech boundaries, then to speaker training data, and finally to identified speakers.","assignee_display_names":["Mark Turner","Jacek Wozny"],"program_year":2017},{"id":5431558319112192,"title":"Laughter Detection from Audio","subcategory":"cross-modal emotion detection and characterization","organization":{"id":6220111078752256,"name":"Red Hen Lab","slug":"red-hen-lab","website_url":"http://redhenlab.org","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"redhenlab@gmail.com","mailing_list":null,"irc_channel":null,"tagline":"Research on Multimodal Communication","precis":"Open-source computational, statistical, and technical tools for big-data study of multimodal communication.","description":"Red Hen Lab is a distributed consortium of researchers in multimodal communication, with participants all over the world.

This year the program has expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator  http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments have announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: detector and accelerator simulation (Falcon, Geant4, GeantV, Pythia, SixTrack), data analysis (ROOT, TMVA, scikit-HEP, Go-HEP), event reconstruction (CMS Tracking), data management (transfer2go) and many others.

This is a long-term aspiration for Oppia, the tool which allows users to collaboratively create interactive tutorial experiences online.\n\n# Interactive learning\nOppia teaches content in small units called _explorations_. _Learners_ (users who visit Oppia to learn something) explore a new topic through an exploration. Explorations are dynamic and interactive, meaning there are multiple paths through the exploration depending on the answers the learner submits (similar to video games). Different answers result in Oppia responding differently. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach.\n\nA user may repeatedly struggle on a certain question. Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor; an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make.\n\n# Community-driven content creation\nThe other half of Oppia is a community of _creators_ (users who create explorations). Oppia offers tools for creating new explorations with the goal of allowing anyone to teach just about anything. Creating explorations is very much like creating a video game, and we face some similar challenges. Our exploration editor needs to help creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, or facilitate easily creating targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners).

In such a space, algorithms like k-Nearest Neighbors can be used for classification.

We value new contributors, just as we prize Open Source and Open Standards.","description":"LibreOffice is a modern Free & Open Source Office suite, one of the largest open source projects, and used by millions of users worldwide. LibreOffice is compatible with many file formats like Microsoft® Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. At its heart though, LibreOffice is built around an open standard, the OpenDocument Format, as its native file format.\n\nLibreOffice is developed by users who, just like you, believe in the principles of Free Software and in sharing their work with the world in non-restrictive ways. The development of LibreOffice is supported by The Document Foundation which provides the infrastructure for the project.\n\nWe believe that users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software that we distribute. While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.\n\nThough the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution & skills.\n\nThe community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations. With tons of different roles in the project, we invite everyone to join us in our work and help us to make LibreOffice known, prosper, and accessible to all.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/oKFpzxvkUYRiTW0UKnMh-BD2nvvLpS3aMuXWDlE-3qTeM0cL2Kgi9z_O0aqji79LN1qxUUsMY2SMz7BMXx_a6itPOUNTRg","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":"https://plus.google.com/+libreoffice/posts","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/libreoffice","blog_url":"https://blog.documentfoundation.org/","application_instructions":"First you should have a look at the Google Summer of Code FAQ and GSoC Student Guide.

Ideally, upstream component developers begin the process by supplying SPDX flies as part of their downloads. Users of those components therefore have a starting point for the SPDX files they create for their \"customers,\" and so on. If everything is working properly, the provenance of each piece of code is researched and documented only once during its journey through a supply chain, and that information is passed on in parallel with the code in the SPDX format.\n\nExecution\n\nDevelopment of SPDX is run somewhat like an open source project: Those that participate influence. Decisions tend to be made by consensus. The spec itself is writen by a technical team with input and support from business and legal teams. Although much of the the initial focus was on Linux and the project is under the auspices of the Linux Foundation, the strategy from the outset has been much broader to be applicable to anything open source. To accommodate a range of needs, SPDX can be implemented in XML or tag-value formats.\n\nThe SPDX \"IP\" is all housed on this site.

There are more and more free wireless groups that meet regularly access in villages and cities.\n\nHardware and Software\n----\n\nMost devices in our networks are routers for home use. They should run with LEDE. In our local communities there are a lot of different approaches for different routing protocols, monitoring systems and map solutions. LEDE as OS for routers and OLSR, BATMAN and Babel as routing daemons are only a few examples of software developed together with freifunk.\nYou can find a great variety of topics where you can go on with wireless communities. We're looking for people working on new hardware drivers, improving routing protocols, developing network monitoring tools and user interface topics on the web interfaces, helping us with new features and tools to organize decentralized communities.\n\nCommon freifunk goals\n----\n\n* Educating and creating awareness on the subject of communication and freedom of information\n* Reducing the digital divide\n* Unhindered distribution of knowledge and resources\n* Empowering people to build and operate their own networks\n* Promote and support existing and new social structures\n\nAs we are decentralized there are some challenges, e.g. to get and show information about communities, working together with all those communties.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/Tu80Q6-06ZCb0Pe0dOXSDlu5rWIloTngJ-yFtxiWcWaMdulrE4QNZvgLfXwzeFWh7aXw_AeTulfhn-bY_FFnC8DH5vKghg","image_bg_color":"","gplus_url":"","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/freifunk","blog_url":"http://blog.freifunk.net","application_instructions":"First steps\n===\n\nPlease take a look on our [ideas page](https://wiki.freifunk.net/ideas) and select the idea you like.

Modular decomposition is decomposition of graph into modules. A module is a subset of vertices and it is a generalization of connected component in graph. Let us take for example a module X. For any vertex v ∉ X it is either connected or not connected to every vertex of X. Another property of module is that a module can be subset of another module. There are various algorithms which have been published for modular decomposition of graphs. The focus in this project is on linear time complexity algorithms which can be practically implemented. The project further aims to use the modules developed for modular decomposition to implement other functionality like skew partitions. Skew partition is partition of graph into two sets of vertices such that induced graph formed by one set is disconnected and induced graph formed by other set is complement of the first. \nModular decomposition is a very important concept in Graph Theory and it has a number of use cases.

Ruby on Rails makes it much easier and more fun. It includes everything you need to build fantastic applications.","description":"Rails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby language. It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started. It allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks. Experienced Rails developers also report that it makes web application development more fun.\n\nRails is opinionated software. It makes the assumption that there is a \"best\" way to do things, and it's designed to encourage that way - and in some cases to discourage alternatives. If you learn \"The Rails Way\" you'll probably discover a tremendous increase in productivity. If you persist in bringing old habits from other languages to your Rails development, and trying to use patterns you learned elsewhere, you may have a less happy experience.\n\nThe Rails philosophy includes two major guiding principles:\n\nDon't Repeat Yourself: DRY is a principle of software development which states that \"Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.\" By not writing the same information over and over again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy.\n\nConvention Over Configuration: Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application, and defaults to this set of conventions, rather than require that you specify every minutiae through endless configuration files.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"MIT license (MIT)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/gFeJzBu88bgv2CiXI1Wh0b5Ui2_jKZYp8-lI-h1b1T4lRlVfiqWWbjbYmZmS7FDGRKUDYstNOVkcBsAkPdyUetmjM1HnPzVY","image_bg_color":"","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/rails","blog_url":"http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/","application_instructions":"https://github.com/railsgsoc/ideas/wiki/2017-Ideas","topic_tags":["web","full stack"],"technology_tags":["html","ruby on rails","ruby"],"proposal_tags":["ruby","rails"],"ideas_list":"https://github.com/railsgsoc/ideas/wiki/2017-Ideas","contact_method":"http://rubyonrails.org/community/","program_year":2017},"student":{"id":5282426847756288,"display_name":"Marko Bogdanović","program_year":2017},"abstract":"Finding out about regressions months in development cycle can often incur a massive cost, fixing bugs early on is cheap.

The HEP Software Foundation (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing. \n\nCERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, http://www.cern.ch) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as CERN-SFT group that provides common software for CERN's experiments. This year the program has expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator  http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments have announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: detector and accelerator simulation (Falcon, Geant4, GeantV, Pythia, SixTrack), data analysis (ROOT, TMVA, scikit-HEP, Go-HEP), event reconstruction (CMS Tracking), data management (transfer2go) and many others.

The lack of such support makes qemu really slow on NetBSD. Testing system installation on a wide variety of platforms is very crucial for any organisation that’s into OS business.

Ardupilot rover version (APMRover2) is well behind Arduplane and ArduCopter in capabilities as they attract more attention from developers.  One obvious example is that Rover has only a very basic avoidance system (turn 45° on obstacle). It is also missing some autonomous features (on spot turn etc.), and more significantly is missing a proper motor configuration abstraction layer. While ArduCopter is capable of being configured in 4,6,8 motors copter with brushed (PWM) or brushless motor (RC PWM), the rover version is still limited to two modes: rover with propulsion and a steering servo (normal mode) and tank mode (skid steering mode), with only support on brushless motor.\nMy proposal to this GSOC is split in two parts. Firstly, reduce the gap between the APMRover2 and the other vehicles to provide a good generic UGV platform capable of multiple configurations, with advance feature such as avoidance.

And thanks to the work by many dedicated people the situation in Plasma is now almost ideal. But unfortunately, this is not the case for all KDE applications.

Competing desktop environments have nowadays a nearly perfect HiDPI support, so I think it is time to face the remaining problems once and for all.\n\nTherefore I suggest the following approach:\nMy Google Summer of Code project will find HiDPI rendering issues in KDE applications and fix them in a coordinated approach. I will look at applications, which are usually installed on the users desktop, like the Plasma Workspace, Systemsettings and utilities from the kdegraphics module (gwenview, okular, spectacle). \n\nThis will also require working together with KDE community members, which report bugs, and application maintainers, to get the submitted patches on the KDE reviewboard in a state that allows them to be committed in their respective repositories.","assignee_display_names":["David Edmundson"],"program_year":2017},{"id":5161428492222464,"title":"Make node.js command-line tool out of oncoprint.js library","subcategory":"javascript","organization":{"id":4894818279882752,"name":"cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics","slug":"cbioportal-for-cancer-genomics","website_url":"http://cbioportal.org/","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":null,"mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cbioportal-gsoc","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"Developing open source solutions for precision medicine for cancer patients","precis":"The cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics is one of the most popular online resource for integrative analysis and visualization of cancer genomics data.","description":"# What is cBioPortal?\nThe cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics is a resource designed to provide broad community access to cancer genomic data.

Microkernel-based operating systems come in many different flavours, each having a distinctive set of goals, features and approaches.

Microkernels and their user environments are most often implemented in the C or C++ programming languages with a little bit of assembly, but other implementation languages (such as Rust) are possible, too.

You should describe what you plan to do as a solution for the problem you defined earlier.\n\n**Timeline:** With the timeline you show that you understand the problem, that you have thought hard about a solution, and that you have also broken the solution down into manageable bits. A modest, realistic and detailed timeline is much better than a timeline that promises to move mountains.\n\n**About me:** Write a few lines about you.","topic_tags":["linux distribution","web development","realtime","virtualization","conferences"],"technology_tags":["ruby on rails","javascript ","docker","linux","angular.js"],"proposal_tags":["osem","portus","jangouts","yast","other"],"ideas_list":"http://101.opensuse.org/gsoc/","contact_method":"opensuse-project@opensuse.org","program_year":2017},"student":{"id":5759432693645312,"display_name":"Nikhil Gupta","program_year":2017},"abstract":"TSP is a Ruby on Rails based application to manage the requests and reimbursements from travel help programs of free software organizations.

At CloudCV, we are building tools that enables researchers to build, compare and share start-of-the-algorithms. We believe that one shouldn’t have to be an AI expert to have access to cutting edge vision algorithms. Likewise, researchers shouldn’t have to worry about building a service around their deep learning models to showcase and share it with others.  \n\nCloudCV consists of three major platforms: \n\n**Origami** is a AI-as-a-service solution that allows researchers to easily convert their deep learning models into an online service that is widely accessible to everyone without the need to setup the infrastructure, resolve the dependencies, and build a web service around the deep learning model. By lowering the barrier to entry to latest AI algorithms, we provide developers, researchers and students the ability to access any model using a simple REST API call.\n\n**Fabrik** is an online collaborative platform to build, visualize and train deep learning models by a simple drag-and-drop approach. It allow researchers to collaboratively develop and debug models using a web GUI that allows importing, editing and exporting networks from widely popular frameworks like Caffe and Keras.\n\n**EvalAI** is an evaluation server that will host AI challenges like Visual Question Answering, Image Captioning. In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to compare an algorithm solving a given task with other existing approaches. These comparisons suffer from minor differences in algorithm implementation, use of non-standard dataset splits and different evaluation metrics.

Presently, deep learning is a very interesting field. However, the issue arises when someone has to  setup someone else's code on their machine. Origami aims at solving that problem by allowing researchers to quickly create a  demo of their implementation for the  world to see. This serves a twofold purpose. It lets other users see if a particular implementation solves their purpose while also serving as a 'portfolio' for the researchers.  \n\nBy the end of the summer, users will be able to search for various demos published by various researchers and thus be able to find an implementation that suits their needs the best. Additionally, Origami will also support REST APIs. This will allow Origami to be used to provide some infrastructure  for chat bots which can then be integrated with Slack, Facebook, etc. Origami will also be integrated with EvalAI to allow users to compare their implementation with that of their competitors. Finally, Origami will support other features such as allowing users to upload to/from Dropbox, releasing anonymous demos, a better CMS and predefined templates to create apps to name a few.","assignee_display_names":["Harsh Agrawal","tocttou"],"program_year":2017},{"id":6464702770053120,"title":"Map of Projects","subcategory":"new feature","organization":{"id":5047226779828224,"name":"Public Lab","slug":"public-laboratory-for-open-technology-and-science","website_url":"https://publiclab.org","category":"other","contact_email":"web@publiclab.org","mailing_list":"http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/plots-dev","irc_channel":"http://gitter.im/publiclab/publiclab","tagline":"Open hardware and software to help communities measure and analyze pollution","precis":"Public Lab is a community and non-profit democratizing science to address environmental issues that affect people.","description":"## Measuring pollution at low cost\n\nPublic Lab is focused on democratizing the tools and techniques of environmental science so that communities who face pollution and other environmental problems can actually use them.\n\nWe believe that low cost, open source, easy to use hardware and software can enable anyone to collect data with which to hold polluters accountable.\n\n## Sensor data and open hardware development\n\nPublic Lab software projects focus on two areas: data processing for our sensors and tools ([MapKnitter.org](http://mapknitter.org) and [SpectralWorkbench.org](https://spectralworkbench.org), among others), and community collaboration and open hardware development ([PublicLab.org](https://PublicLab.org)). \n\nOur browser-based data analysis tools make use of HTML5 features such as CSS 3d transforms for image distortion and the WebRTC webcam API for capturing spectral data, to make advanced features available to users in a powerful cross-platform, user-friendly, database-backed approach to open science tools.

ViSP allows to design vision-based tasks for eye-in-hand and eye-to-hand visual servoing that contains the most classical visual features that are used in practice. It involves a large set of elementary positioning tasks with respect to various visual features (points, segments, straight lines, circles, spheres, cylinders, image moments, pose...) that can be combined together, and image processing algorithms that allow tracking of visual cues (dots, segments, ellipses...) or 3D model-based tracking of known objects or template tracking. Simulation capabilities are also available.\n\nReleases as well as daily snapshots can be downloaded as source code tarball or zip. ViSP is also packaged as binary packages for Debian, Ubuntu, ArchLinux, OSX, iOS, and for ROS framework.\n\nThe user site is at https://visp.inria.fr/.

A seminal contribution in this field was the development of the GARCH model by Bollerslev (1986) where the volatility is a function of past asset returns. The GARCH model is today a widespread tool in risk management. However, recent studies show that estimates of GARCH models can be biased by structural breaks in the volatility dynamics (Bauwens et al., 2010; Bauwens et al., 2014). These structural breaks typically occur during periods of financial turmoil. Estimating a GARCH model on data displaying a structural break yields a non-stationary estimated model and implies poor risk predictions. A way to cope with this problem is provided by Markov-switching GARCH models (MSGARCH) whose parameters vary over time according to some regimes. These models can quickly adapt to variations in the unconditional volatility level, which improves risk predictions (see Ardia, 2008).","assignee_display_names":["Brian Peterson","kboudt","ArdiaD"],"program_year":2017},{"id":6148503653842944,"title":"Markovchain package","subcategory":"existing package","organization":{"id":4947241283354624,"name":"R project for statistical computing","slug":"r-project-for-statistical-computing","website_url":"https://www.r-project.org/","category":"languages","contact_email":"gsoc-r@googlegroups.com","mailing_list":"https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2017/wiki","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics","precis":"R provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible.
