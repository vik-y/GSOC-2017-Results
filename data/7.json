It is dedicated to research on programming languages, with emphasis on the Lua language and reactive programming. It was founded on May 2004 by Prof. Roberto Ierusalimschy, the chief architect of the Lua language.\n\nLabLua consists of people from a wide range of backgrounds, including PhD candidates, professors and alumni who are the developers and maintainers of projects that are used by the Lua community at large.\n \n## What is Lua?\n[Lua](http://www.lua.org/) is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language. It supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, data-driven programming, and data description.\n\nLua has been used in many industrial applications (e.g., Adobe's Photoshop Lightroom), with an emphasis on embedded systems (e.g., the Ginga middleware for digital TV in Brazil) and games (e.g., World of Warcraft and Angry Birds). Several versions of Lua have been released and used in real applications since its creation in 1993.\n\n## What is Céu?\n[Céu](http://www.ceu-lang.org/) provides \"Structured Synchronous Reactive Programming\", a safe and deterministic concurrency model with side effects. Reactive applications interact continuously with the environment and are mostly guided through input events from it.  Céu can be described as a reactive, imperative, concurrent, synchronous, and deterministic language, which easily integrates with C and Lua.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"MIT license (MIT)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/fxBPZZrlTA7QpmbEpDR5XbJ0pMcA0DgAnMKzkITP_xFLopTk_kIk_AgbcXtDnbeu1mjgp6mh5-rxgv-nnQF9A-M1FlBQVfk","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"# Applying to Google Summer of Code at LabLua\n\n## The ideas list\nCheck out our [ideas web page](http://www.lua.inf.puc-rio.br/gsoc/ideas2017.html) or propose your own!\n\n## Getting in touch\nYou are encouraged to contact us before submitting your application.

It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code,  find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines.\nAll controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\n\n## For Users\n\ncoala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool.\nBesides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.\n\n## For Developers\n\nYou can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind. That means: no big boilerplate, just write one small object with one routine, add the parameters you like and see how coala automates the organisation of settings, user interaction and execution parallelisation.\n\n## For Newcomers\n\ncoala offers a great newcomer experience with an in depth step by step guide for your first contribution, extensive documentation of the whole workflow and fast and easy communication over the gitter channel.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Affero GNU Public License","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/WbQZ28FFe1fjF8nl3n3s7WaIA47dnpDpTdFRba3Y9iW34XtHL2PQanntLbUdmADFI_rjGwb6xX6ABMqLQtthAgOJW71ZFsA","image_bg_color":"ffffff","gplus_url":"","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/coala_analyzer","blog_url":"https://blog.coala.io","application_instructions":"Please read our FAQ at http://projects.coala.io/#/faq carefully and get started with our newcomer tutorial at https://coala.io/newcomer as well as being active on https://coala.io/chat.","topic_tags":["code analysis"],"technology_tags":["python"],"proposal_tags":["vulture","rstcheck","jetbrains","coala","gitmate"],"ideas_list":"https://projects.coala.io/","contact_method":"http://coala.io/chat","program_year":2017},"student":{"id":6003015052951552,"display_name":"Alexandru-Sorin Maxim","program_year":2017},"abstract":"coala has come a long way from its early days in terms of its usability, although all the changes that have been made are improvisations.

While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.\n\nThough the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution & skills.\n\nThe community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations.

Likewise, researchers shouldn’t have to worry about building a service around their deep learning models to showcase and share it with others.  \n\nCloudCV consists of three major platforms: \n\n**Origami** is a AI-as-a-service solution that allows researchers to easily convert their deep learning models into an online service that is widely accessible to everyone without the need to setup the infrastructure, resolve the dependencies, and build a web service around the deep learning model. By lowering the barrier to entry to latest AI algorithms, we provide developers, researchers and students the ability to access any model using a simple REST API call.\n\n**Fabrik** is an online collaborative platform to build, visualize and train deep learning models by a simple drag-and-drop approach. It allow researchers to collaboratively develop and debug models using a web GUI that allows importing, editing and exporting networks from widely popular frameworks like Caffe and Keras.\n\n**EvalAI** is an evaluation server that will host AI challenges like Visual Question Answering, Image Captioning. In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to compare an algorithm solving a given task with other existing approaches. These comparisons suffer from minor differences in algorithm implementation, use of non-standard dataset splits and different evaluation metrics. By providing a central leaderboard and submission interface, we make it easier for researchers to reproduce the results mentioned in the paper and perform reliable & accurate quantitative analysis.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/kL1VyMKkoJl04xEQV0yoQOfBXCpHUZgpZrC9Ta0Cq7PD6NwoGcXCNCeCz2IVyBgkXjxy9rrN_CjdLxsUXy0JV8M4HP0nfhY","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"","blog_url":"","application_instructions":"Follow these general steps to apply to our organization.\n\n**Join the CloudCV google groups / gitter channel and introduce yourself.**    \nhttps://gitter.im/Cloud-CV    \nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cloudcv\n\nNot only do we get to know you, but you can get feedback on project ideas and get help as you start working with our codebase.

Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being widely used in academic research. \n\nThe primary sub-projects of LLVM are:\n*  The LLVM Core libraries provide a modern source- and target-independent optimizer, along with code generation support for many popular CPUs. These libraries are built around a well specified code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (\"LLVM IR\").\n*  Clang is an \"LLVM native\" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles, extremely useful error and warning messages and to provide a platform for building great source level tools. The Clang Static Analyzer is a clang-based tool that automatically finds bugs in your code.\n*  The LLDB project builds on libraries provided by LLVM and Clang to provide a great native debugger on top of Clang and LLVM libraries.\n*  The libc++ and libc++ ABI projects provide a standard conformant and high-performance implementation of the C++ Standard Library.\n*  The polly project implements a suite of cache-locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and vectorization using a polyhedral model.\n*  The lld project aims to be the built-in linker for clang/llvm.

Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (http://regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (http://pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in dozens of developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and India.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/sVDHWw3LviXkpfFg0c7JL5ScXMi45mmZhrVxqaZIiwpgKR3rkb32_KaXocjw_bnoll_ePtotlYF99VjXufs9yiBxi6QGZxjQ","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/openmrs","blog_url":"http://openmrs.org/blog/","application_instructions":"Thanks for applying to OpenMRS for GSoC 2017!

Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.\n\nWe do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes [Processing (Java)](http://processing.org), [p5.js (JavaScript)](http://p5js.org), and [Processing.py (Python)](http://py.processing.org/), and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.\n\nThe Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or ability. We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.\n\nAt our core is the philosophy and politics of open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skillset, but is instead a creative and exploratory process.

This year the program has expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator  http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments have announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: detector and accelerator simulation (Falcon, Geant4, GeantV, Pythia, SixTrack), data analysis (ROOT, TMVA, scikit-HEP, Go-HEP), event reconstruction (CMS Tracking), data management (transfer2go) and many others.

But if you have a wacky idea, we might still be interested if we can turn it into something achievable in 3 months.\r\n- Be appropriate: Demonstrate you have a knowledge of Apertium, how it works and the problem it has that you'd like to solve.\r\n- Have a plan: Three months may seem like a long time, but it isn't. Provide a weekly plan with dates and deliverables. Leave time for getting familiar with the platform — ideally before, or in the community bonding period — and for documentation. If you plan to work on a language pair, make yourself familiar with testvoc and other quality controls, and factor those in. If you know of any breaks or absences beforehand, mention them and plan around them.\r\n- Get in contact ASAP!: We get lots of proposals: only a few are good. Contact your potential mentor as soon as possible: send your proposal to the mailing list, hang out on IRC, ask for feedback, and refine your application based on feedback. If you are remembered, you are more likely to be picked.\r\n- Read the Ideas Page! If you find yourself asking 'do you have any Java/Python/Fortran/x86 assembler projects...' -- you didn't read the ideas page.

There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.\n\nJPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android. JPF is constantly being extended with support for verification of new types of properties and for new types of application domains.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/bnseafUGkhHioi5kR6ZewNTKSQX2t9Sz7IEA0vAuY39pr9PeVCvPdg1hWGDEW6Z6sIOXuimh1jK4Nk7tu525zpwBtaY9Ass","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"JPF is written in Java, and it analyzes Java bytecode.

For today one of the significant problems with it is the fact that its test suite is inoperative. It could be explained by its fragile design implying checking of the string output for the input program which is also defined by a string. Therefore, there is a chance that some bugs in the current Symbolic PathFinder implementation are hidden. In addition, there are also a lot of other different problems that could be considered as technical debt (i.e. ineffective methods, bad design, documentation, naming, etc.). \n\nWithin this project described problems are going to be mitigated. First of all, test suite will be repaired. Secondly, it will be enhanced by application of different approach to test generating (namely, input will be specified by objects instead of string representation of program). Finally, overall quality of code base will be improved through optimizing and redesigning components, refactoring code and improving documentation.","assignee_display_names":["Kasper Luckow","Aymeric Fromherz"],"program_year":2017},{"id":5651524398088192,"title":"Improving SymEngine's Python Wrappers and SymPy-SymEngine Integration","subcategory":"symengine","organization":{"id":6299627591565312,"name":"SymPy","slug":"sympy","website_url":"http://www.sympy.org/","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":null,"mailing_list":"http://groups.google.com/group/sympy","irc_channel":"https://gitter.im/sympy/sympy","tagline":"SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics.","precis":"SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics.","description":"SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics.

However, bottleneck exists in terms of how much data can be transferred between hard disk and memory for computation  [1]. As research increasingly relies on processing huge volumes of data, this issue demands attention. One strategy which addresses this is memory compression of data in memory (DRAM). Algorithms that are effective do a good job of decompressing exactly as much of the data as are needed for the calculations, so that they still minimize the memory footprint of the program without significant speed drops.\n\nThis proposal exists to address this bottleneck within the Neuromapp program created by members of the Blue Brain Project team. The project proposed is split into research and implementation of in-memory compression along the lines of compression library selection, interface algorithm development, and block data structure design. The resulting compression mini-app is intended to relieve this bottleneck, and provide accelerated calculation capacity for the suite of associated mini-apps that come with Neuromapp.","assignee_display_names":["Timothée Ewart","Francesco"],"program_year":2017},{"id":6483499291770880,"title":"Incorporate Zebra into GDP for HTML5-based UIs","subcategory":"gdp","organization":{"id":6226090612752384,"name":"GENIVI Development Platform","slug":"genivi-development-platform","website_url":"https://at.projects.genivi.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=11567210","category":"languages","contact_email":"zeeshan.ali@pelagicore.com","mailing_list":"http://lists.genivi.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/genivi-projects","irc_channel":"https://at.projects.genivi.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=11567210#GENIVIDevelopmentPlatform(GDP)-HowdoIcontributetotheGENIVIDevelopmentPlatform?","tagline":"Open Source Automotive Development Platform","precis":"Open Source Automotive Development Platform","description":"The GENIVI Development Platform is an Open Source project for automotive with three main goals:\n\n* Deliver a system developers can use to create software components for automotive.\n* A platform focused on automotive use cases to enable developers to create applications and demos targeting the industry.\n* A starter kit that can be downloaded and customized for different hardware focused in automotive use cases.\n\nTo achieve these goals, GDP has two main deliverables from the official project, plus spins:\n\n* [GDP Releases](https://at.projects.genivi.org/wiki/display/GDP/GDP+releases): images released regularly to make the integrated software easy to consume.\n* [GDP Master](https://at.projects.genivi.org/wiki/display/GDP/GDP+Master): integration point where more experienced developers can build from scratch their own images.\n* [GDP Spins](https://at.projects.genivi.org/wiki/display/GDP/GDP+Spins) are endorsed variations of GDP developed by other teams/companies to show off a unique HMI or application standard.\n\nCheck a more detailed description of GDP components through the wiki page [GDP In Detail](https://at.projects.genivi.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=11567879).

It's also a great choice for creating integrated digital frameworks. You can extend it with any one, or many, of thousands of add-ons. Modules expand Drupal's functionality. Themes let you customize your content's presentation. Distributions are packaged Drupal bundles you can use as starter-kits. Mix and match these components to enhance Drupal's core abilities. Or, integrate Drupal with external services and other applications in your infrastructure. No other content management software is this powerful and scalable. The Drupal project is open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. It's distributed under the terms of the GNU (GPL). There are no licensing fees, ever. Drupal will always be free. The Drupal community is one of the largest open source communities in the world. We're more than 1,000,000 passionate developers, designers, trainers, strategists, coordinators, editors, and sponsors working together. We build Drupal, provide support, create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit pushes the Drupal project forward. New members are always welcome. Drupal 8 is the biggest update in Drupal's history. Creating content is easier. Every built-in theme is responsively designed.

At the heart of Jitsi are Jitsi Videobridge and Jitsi Meet, which let you have conferences on the internet, while other projects in the community enable other features such as audio / video calls con the desktop.\n\nThe Jitsi family, and hence our GSoC project ideas, also include other projects:\n\nJitsi Meet - A WebRTC JavaScript application for videoconferencing, which uses XMPP Jingle for signalling and Jitsi Videobridge as a server-side media router. (https://jitsi.org/meet)\n\nJitsi Videobridge - A video relaying server that, together with Jitsi allows for multi-party video calls similar to the ones we do with Google Hangouts (https://jitsi.org/videobridge)\n\nJitsi (desktop) is an audio/video and chat communicator written in Java. It supports protocols such as SIP, XMPP/Jabber, AIM/ICQ, Yahoo!, and Bonjour. It implements a rich set of communications features such as Video calls and conferences with SIP and XMPP Jingle on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows, call transfers, call encryption and many others. \n\nlibjitsi - A rich audio/video media stack written in Java (https://jitsi.org/libjitsi)\n \nice4j.org - An ICE protocol implementation for robust NAT and firewall traversal (http://ice4j.org)\n\nTogether with FLOSS server software like Kamailio, OpenSIPS, Asterisk and FreeSWITCH, Jitsi represents an open alternative to proprietary communications systems such as Skype, or Live Messenger. Our communities often work together on various problems.\n\nThe development of Jitsi started at the University of Strasbourg, France (http://www.unistra.fr) but has grown to include contributors from all over the world. Many of them have actually joined after successfully participating in previous GSoC editions. Jitsi is based on the OSGi (http://osgi.org) architecture using the Felix implementation from Apache, which makes it very extensible and developer friendly.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/sbILjUAUCzlt_OhXx9lCso_Ufxtseg_Bqd1gcATW71RUNZaS-WZ3VeVTHZwv3TsukNwkuIocbzM-GnKqwX5fG9c4-2pSvQs","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/jitsinews","blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"Do you want to participate in GSoC for the Jitsi organization?

First steps have been made to encapsulate CBS Tools’ Java classes using the JCC package, enabling access through Python. Within the Google Summer of Code I would like to take this further and provide easy-to-use and well-documented Python interfaces for the core modules of CBS Tools. Since rapid advances in the dynamic field of high-resolution neuroimaging are to be expected, another focus of my proposal is to facilitate future contribution of other researchers.

It has currently integrated a few resources, including OncoKB, MyCancerGenome, and CancerHotspot.org in the annotation column in the mutation table. In addition to this, it would be useful to link to clinical trials too for each mutation.\nClinical trials are a key research tool for advancing medical knowledge and patient care. They are an important step in discovering new treatments for cancers and other diseases as well as new ways to detect, diagnose, and reduce the risk of disease. Therefore I propose to link clinical trials for cancer studies in CBioPortal which will improve the ability to analyze and interpret the genomic data for various kinds of mutations.

Such hardware designs can for example be single \"IP blocks\" or entire system-on-chip (SoC). Our vision is that there will be multiple open source chips in the next years. Our main effort is our community hub website [LibreCores.org](http://www.librecores.org).\n\nBeside single components and entire SoCs, we see open source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools as a crucial for the advance of FOSSi. We therefore encourage and support open source synthesis tools, simulators and system generators, just to mention a few.\n\nWith those activities we are steadily working on advancing FOSSi and make it the next success after Open Source Software and (tangible) Open Source Hardware.

This year the program has expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator  http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments have announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: detector and accelerator simulation (Falcon, Geant4, GeantV, Pythia, SixTrack), data analysis (ROOT, TMVA, scikit-HEP, Go-HEP), event reconstruction (CMS Tracking), data management (transfer2go) and many others.

It includes\n\n- an effective data handling and storage facility,\n- a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,\n- a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,\n- graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and\n- a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.\n\nThe term “environment” is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.\n\nR, like S, is designed around a true computer language, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nMany users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/e6UifH3TR9p8a-8sKngoEkMHw_0yJ1ssFPNN1WH-gkUOHdRwf_qU-O5UVhN3co1AZzrI7atjqYKTtl6p-z6sKq65rRanTg","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":"http://www.r-bloggers.com/","application_instructions":"1. look for a project on\nhttps://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2017/wiki/table-of-proposed-coding-projects\n\n2.

Many XML variants were developed to represent diagrams, including SBML and SBGN. However, SBML can represent much more complex models than SBGN. For example, the SBML qual extension package can mechanistically describe events in its models, such as the relationship that A activates C, B activates C, but A and B cannot activate C at the same time. The SBGN Activity Flow language can describe a similar relationship, but the relationship is represented visually only, and therefore is not stored in its model. The incompatibilities between SBML and SBGN prevent direct comparison between the models. \n\nIn this project, I will build a standalone library to support bidirectional conversion between SBML and SBGN, which acts as a machinery to map between SBGN-specific and SBML-specific information. SBML Layout package will be used to represent SBML diagrams, and the SBML qual package used to store the logic model.  The tools built in this project allow developers and researchers to understand SBML and SBGN models with less manual effort.","assignee_display_names":["Nicolas Rodriguez"],"program_year":2017},{"id":6366660538662912,"title":"InterMine Registry","subcategory":"intermine","organization":{"id":6329848994725888,"name":"Open Genome Informatics","slug":"open-genome-informatics","website_url":"http://gmod.org/wiki/GSoC","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"robin.haw@oicr.on.ca","mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/genome-informatics","irc_channel":"http://irc.lc/freenode/genomeinformatics/","tagline":"Open Genome Informatics represents the efforts of many bioinformatics projects.","precis":"Open Genome Informatics group is organizing the joint efforts of Dockstore, Galaxy, GBrowse, GMOD, Informatics and Bio-computing (OICR), JBrowse, and Reactome.","description":"This is a great opportunity for students to contribute to the work of these established bioinformatics projects:\n\n**Galaxy**: An open, web-based platform for accessible, reproducible, and transparent computational biomedical research.

Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual machines. LLVM began as a research project at the University of Illinois, with the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming languages. Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being widely used in academic research. \n\nThe primary sub-projects of LLVM are:\n*  The LLVM Core libraries provide a modern source- and target-independent optimizer, along with code generation support for many popular CPUs. These libraries are built around a well specified code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (\"LLVM IR\").\n*  Clang is an \"LLVM native\" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles, extremely useful error and warning messages and to provide a platform for building great source level tools. The Clang Static Analyzer is a clang-based tool that automatically finds bugs in your code.\n*  The LLDB project builds on libraries provided by LLVM and Clang to provide a great native debugger on top of Clang and LLVM libraries.\n*  The libc++ and libc++ ABI projects provide a standard conformant and high-performance implementation of the C++ Standard Library.\n*  The polly project implements a suite of cache-locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and vectorization using a polyhedral model.\n*  The lld project aims to be the built-in linker for clang/llvm. Currently, clang must invoke the system linker to produce executables.\n\nIn addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of other projects that use components of LLVM for various tasks.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License (NCSA)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Y59P6nMhS1_qWD79cA8HEr6ZqliJz7NfgE8OCVQ_O5efghU8UjMO6wR2euj0C31PemAmLjuDEJOF6_fK-sE_if6QPX4ZTM","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"http://twitter.com/llvmorg","blog_url":"http://blog.llvm.org","application_instructions":"All the applications should submit their proposals to the corresponding subproject mailing list (e.g. llvm-dev for LLVM core projects, clang-dev for clang-related and so on).

Usually vague proposals give the impression that the student does not actually know sufficient about the topic to spend time efficiently.\n*  Be honest and realistic. A small, simple project with clearly defined goals that doesn't require much prior knowledge is preferred\n*  Students that have already contributed to LLVM or submitted good patches in general give a better impression\n* Ideally the project should be useful to LLVM and be ready to be integrated into LLVM mainline  after GSoC\n\nStarting with small patch for the area you are interested in before the proposal submission period can help since it allows you to get the code known and to decide whether you really want to do the project, it shows the development procedure and helps potential mentors to judge the proposal based on actual prior work.","topic_tags":["compiler","compilers"],"technology_tags":["llvm","clang"],"proposal_tags":["llvm","clang","polly","lld","lldb","compiler-rt"],"ideas_list":"http://llvm.org/OpenProjects.html#gsoc17","contact_method":"llvm-dev@lists.llvm.org","program_year":2017},"student":{"id":5361751276126208,"display_name":"malhar1995","program_year":2017},"abstract":"Maintaining consistency while manual reference counting is very difficult. Languages like Java, C#, Go and other scripting languages employ garbage collection which automatically performs memory management. On the other hand, there are certain libraries like ISL (Integer Set Library) which use memory annotations in function declarations to declare what happens to an object’s ownership, thereby  specifying the  responsibility of  releasing it as well. However, improper memory management in ISL leads to invocations of runtime errors. Hence, my proposal is to employ a robust static analyzer in clang which raises warnings in case there is a possibility of a memory leak, double free, etc.","assignee_display_names":["Devin Coughlin"],"program_year":2017},{"id":6301175977607168,"title":"istSOS-Data analysis and statistical tools suite","subcategory":"istsos","organization":{"id":4660070039158784,"name":"OSGeo","slug":"osgeo","website_url":"http://www.osgeo.org/","category":"end_user_applications","contact_email":"soc@lists.osgeo.org","mailing_list":"http://www.osgeo.org/content/faq/mailing_lists.html#discuss","irc_channel":"https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/IRC","tagline":"Open Source Geospatial Foundation","precis":"OSGeo is a non-profit organization serving as an umbrella organization for the Open Source Geospatial community.","description":"OSGeo is a non-profit organization serving as an umbrella organization for the Open Source Geospatial community in general and several code projects in particular:\n\n## *Web Mapping* ##\n\ndeegree, geomajas, GeoMOOSE, GeoServer, Mapbender, MapFish, MapGuide Open Source, MapServer, OpenLayers\n\n## *Desktop Applications* ##\n\nGRASS GIS, gvSIG, Marble, QGIS\n\n## *Geospatial Libraries* ##\n\nFDO, GDAL/OGR, GEOS, GeoTools, OSSIM, PostGIS\n\n## *Metadata Catalogues* ##\n\nGeoNetwork, pycsw\n\n## *Content Management Systems* ##\n\nGeoNode\n\n## *Other Incubating Projects* ##\n\nistSOS, MetaCRS, Opticks, Orfeo ToolBox (OTB), PyWPS, Team Engine, ZOO-Project\n\n## *Other (non-code) Projects* ##\n\nGeoForAll (Education and Curriculum), OSGeo-Live DVD, Public Geospatial Data\n\nWe host regional and international FOSS4G conferences with typical attendance of 500-1000+ geospatial developers, industry and government leaders, and researchers.
