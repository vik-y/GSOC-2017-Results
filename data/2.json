Consequently, several difficulties are found when improvements/changes need to be performed. This library is commonly described as too verbose, implying most of the times, string concatenations and mixed code for both presentation and logic. Subsequently, it is not much intuitive. In addition, recent patch update from 1.2.9 to 1.2.10 resulted in a backward compatibility break, and as a minor patch should not raise compatibility issues, the trust in this library is somehow compromised.\nTemplate Engines overcome the majority of the issues related to output generation. They are powerful tools that allow the developers to speed up their work in an easier and much cleaner way.\n \nThis project proposes moving antiSMASH to jinja2, a well known, widely used and developer-friendly templating language for Python. With this migration, we intend to facilitate the future development of antiSMASH as well as the onboarding of new developers to the team. Moreover, considering jinja2 enormous user-base and applications, a backwards compatibility break in a minor version is unlikely.","assignee_display_names":["Marc Chevrette","Dr. Kai Blin"],"program_year":2017},{"id":6436501203189760,"title":"Apache -VXQUERY-180 (RESTful API)","subcategory":"from ideas list","organization":{"id":5416945173135360,"name":"Apache Software Foundation","slug":"apache-software-foundation","website_url":"http://www.apache.org","category":"other","contact_email":"dev@community.apache.org","mailing_list":"http://apache.org/foundation/mailinglists.html","irc_channel":"https://wiki.apache.org/general/IRC","tagline":"Providing open source software to the public free of charge","precis":"Founded in 1999, the Apache Software Foundation is home to over 180 projects and countless contributors","description":"The Apache Software Foundation provides organizational, legal, and financial support for a broad range of open source software projects.

It has already developed good logical structures for sending of push notifications using JMS. Moreover,  its \"sender\" module is mainly constructed of different message queues and their producers and consumers. On the other hand, the server DB is currently based on MySQL/PostgreSQL and each data entry lies in one DB scheme.\n   We need the process for sending of push notifications and the evaluation of message metrics to be as fast as possible and as scalable as possible. Therefore, with an increase of our data problems can be caused by slow writes/reads to DB and not scalable enough message queue usage.\n    The idea of the project is to try to overcome these obstacles and rebuild some modules of the system in the way that they perform well even if the data volume they are operating over increases. For that two different approaches can be taken. To speed up the DB access a new distributed, scalable, big data store HBase can be integrated into the project. For more scalable processing of the data, Apache Kafka can be used instead of JMS.","assignee_display_names":["Matthias Wessendorf"],"program_year":2017},{"id":6646070978281472,"title":"Apache OODT : Rework OODT configuration to make use of Zookeeper for distributed configuration management","subcategory":"from ideas list","organization":{"id":5416945173135360,"name":"Apache Software Foundation","slug":"apache-software-foundation","website_url":"http://www.apache.org","category":"other","contact_email":"dev@community.apache.org","mailing_list":"http://apache.org/foundation/mailinglists.html","irc_channel":"https://wiki.apache.org/general/IRC","tagline":"Providing open source software to the public free of charge","precis":"Founded in 1999, the Apache Software Foundation is home to over 180 projects and countless contributors","description":"The Apache Software Foundation provides organizational, legal, and financial support for a broad range of open source software projects.

This is complex to manage and creates problems when the platform is distributed across servers or geographically. Therefore, the objective of this project is to migrate the OODT configuration to an optional zookeeper module so that the OODT components can register themselves in the zookeeper ensemble accordingly and maintain each component’s state regardless of the scale of the cluster. The proposed zookeeper module will minimize the manual configuration required when configuring OODT components. That is, this module will make use of the inherited configuration at component level. For example consider the file manager. Almost all the configurations of file manager instances are identical. Therefore, new file managers which are coming up later will inherit the configuration of the initial file managers and will almost remove the manual configuration required when adding new nodes to the cluster.","assignee_display_names":["Tom Barber"],"program_year":2017},{"id":5013603106160640,"title":"API for Facial Landmark Detector","subcategory":"computer vision","organization":{"id":5987197309157376,"name":"OpenCV","slug":"opencv","website_url":"http://opencv.org","category":"graphics","contact_email":"opencv-gsoc-2017@googlegroups.com","mailing_list":"https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/GSoC_2017","irc_channel":"http://opencv.org","tagline":"Open Source Computer Vision and Machine Learning Library","precis":"OpenCV, the Open Source Computer Vision Library includes state of the art computer vision and deep learning algorithms.

This is a long-term aspiration for Oppia, the tool which allows users to collaboratively create interactive tutorial experiences online.\n\n# Interactive learning\nOppia teaches content in small units called _explorations_. _Learners_ (users who visit Oppia to learn something) explore a new topic through an exploration. Explorations are dynamic and interactive, meaning there are multiple paths through the exploration depending on the answers the learner submits (similar to video games). Different answers result in Oppia responding differently. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach.\n\nA user may repeatedly struggle on a certain question. Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor; an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make.\n\n# Community-driven content creation\nThe other half of Oppia is a community of _creators_ (users who create explorations). Oppia offers tools for creating new explorations with the goal of allowing anyone to teach just about anything. Creating explorations is very much like creating a video game, and we face some similar challenges. Our exploration editor needs to help creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, or facilitate easily creating targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners).

This year the program has expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator  http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments have announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: detector and accelerator simulation (Falcon, Geant4, GeantV, Pythia, SixTrack), data analysis (ROOT, TMVA, scikit-HEP, Go-HEP), event reconstruction (CMS Tracking), data management (transfer2go) and many others.

The next step is the Event Streaming Service (ESS). Since AES already streams event processing assignments to workers, we could also stream the input data that are specifically needed for an assignment. This way, worker storage will be used efficiently and network latencies will be eliminated since the input data will exist locally. The ESS will prefetch the data asynchronously from the assignment’s payload in near real time.

While it is easy for a human to recognize the emotional load of Bach symphonies, how can it be done by a computer? Currently, algorithms are able to analyze low level features like signals energy. Those features are far from capturing how does the stimuli actually sound to us, and the best we can do is to ask a human subject to judge.\nThe following project aims to bridge the gap between human- and machine-like sound understanding by building an audio embedding space. Such embeddings have been proven extremely successful for texts (word2vec) and images (image recognition, convolutional neural networks, vgg). The aim of this project is to offer similar insight into the nature of the audio stimuli. \nThe embedding space will be obtained by a machine learning model trained to perform on various audio task.

This means that Scala grows with you. At the root, the language’s scalability is the result of a careful integration of object-oriented and functional language concepts.\n\nScala is the preferred workhorse language for many mission critical server systems. The generated code is on a par with Java’s and its precise typing means that many problems are caught at compile-time rather than after deployment.\n\n# Object-Oriented\nScala is a pure-bred object-oriented language. Conceptually, every value is an object and every operation is a method-call. The language supports advanced component architectures through classes and traits.\n\n# Functional\nEven though its syntax is fairly conventional, Scala is also a full-blown functional language. It has everything you would expect, including first-class functions, a library with efficient immutable data structures, and a general preference of immutability over mutation.\n\n# Seamless Java Interop\nScala runs on the JVM. Java and Scala classes can be freely mixed, no matter whether they reside in different projects or in the same. They can even mutually refer to each other, the Scala compiler contains a subset of a Java compiler to make sense of such recursive dependencies.\n\n# Fun\nMaybe most important is that programming in Scala tends to be very enjoyable. No boilerplate, rapid iteration, but at the same time the safety of a strong static type system.

It allows users to analyse projects containing multiple languages with just one tool, using just one configuration and seeing just one user interface.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nWith coala, you create just one configuration file. It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code,  find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines.\nAll controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\n\n## For Users\n\ncoala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool.\nBesides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.\n\n## For Developers\n\nYou can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind. That means: no big boilerplate, just write one small object with one routine, add the parameters you like and see how coala automates the organisation of settings, user interaction and execution parallelisation.\n\n## For Newcomers\n\ncoala offers a great newcomer experience with an in depth step by step guide for your first contribution, extensive documentation of the whole workflow and fast and easy communication over the gitter channel.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Affero GNU Public License","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/WbQZ28FFe1fjF8nl3n3s7WaIA47dnpDpTdFRba3Y9iW34XtHL2PQanntLbUdmADFI_rjGwb6xX6ABMqLQtthAgOJW71ZFsA","image_bg_color":"ffffff","gplus_url":"","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/coala_analyzer","blog_url":"https://blog.coala.io","application_instructions":"Please read our FAQ at http://projects.coala.io/#/faq carefully and get started with our newcomer tutorial at https://coala.io/newcomer as well as being active on https://coala.io/chat.","topic_tags":["code analysis"],"technology_tags":["python"],"proposal_tags":["vulture","rstcheck","jetbrains","coala","gitmate"],"ideas_list":"https://projects.coala.io/","contact_method":"http://coala.io/chat","program_year":2017},"student":{"id":5009088955023360,"display_name":"Rahul Jha [:RJ722]","program_year":2017},"abstract":"vulture is a tool which detects and reports dead (unused) code and coala is an automatic linter.\nThe motivation of this proposal is to:\n* **Extend vulture as an API** which respects the Bear's Input Output method\n* **Refactor VultureBear** such as to use the new API - this would highly optimize it's performance.\n* **Enhance python whitelist** and making it **default** for every run.\n* Implement a method to **acquire the source range of dead code** - currently, only the beginning of the dead code is reported.\n* Revamp vulture's scavenging property by additional *detection of the cases which render the **code unreachable** *.\n* Implement a **confidence value with results** - this would be necessary when implementing *auto* removal, as we would need a proportion of surety or certainty with which we report dead code.","assignee_display_names":["Jendrik"],"program_year":2017},{"id":6453165883916288,"title":"Automate performance testing and reporting","subcategory":"from ideas list","organization":{"id":5416945173135360,"name":"Apache Software Foundation","slug":"apache-software-foundation","website_url":"http://www.apache.org","category":"other","contact_email":"dev@community.apache.org","mailing_list":"http://apache.org/foundation/mailinglists.html","irc_channel":"https://wiki.apache.org/general/IRC","tagline":"Providing open source software to the public free of charge","precis":"Founded in 1999, the Apache Software Foundation is home to over 180 projects and countless contributors","description":"The Apache Software Foundation provides organizational, legal, and financial support for a broad range of open source software projects.

Defending and fighting against malicious attacks requires tools and techniques to recognize their origin, family, actor, purpose and modus operandi. In this project, I will develop a system that can use a wide range of malware analytic outputs (source code, DNS/ASN data, peinfo results, yara rules, IPs, domains etc.) to automatically detect relationships  between malicious objects in a database and assign a score to each detected relationship. This system should accept user requests for analytic jobs and utilize distributed machine learning techniques and tools in order to extract knowledge out of the malware-related Big Data available. The system output for the analyst should be a graphical representation of the generated results.","assignee_display_names":["webstergd","Huang3","Zachary Hanif"],"program_year":2017},{"id":5753119225937920,"title":"Automated Testing - Photo Language Translation","subcategory":"web","organization":{"id":5368506909458432,"name":"Systers, an Anita Borg Institute community","slug":"systers-an-anita-borg-institute-community","website_url":"http://systers.org","category":"other","contact_email":"gsoc-admins@anitaborg.org","mailing_list":"http://systers.org/mailman/listinfo/systers-dev","irc_channel":"http://systers.io/slack-systers-opensource/","tagline":"Helping women find their potential in code.","precis":"Increasing the number of women in computing fields and technology.","description":"Systers is a community for all women involved in the technical aspects of computing.

But if you have a wacky idea, we might still be interested if we can turn it into something achievable in 3 months.\r\n- Be appropriate: Demonstrate you have a knowledge of Apertium, how it works and the problem it has that you'd like to solve.\r\n- Have a plan: Three months may seem like a long time, but it isn't. Provide a weekly plan with dates and deliverables. Leave time for getting familiar with the platform — ideally before, or in the community bonding period — and for documentation. If you plan to work on a language pair, make yourself familiar with testvoc and other quality controls, and factor those in. If you know of any breaks or absences beforehand, mention them and plan around them.\r\n- Get in contact ASAP!: We get lots of proposals: only a few are good. Contact your potential mentor as soon as possible: send your proposal to the mailing list, hang out on IRC, ask for feedback, and refine your application based on feedback. If you are remembered, you are more likely to be picked.\r\n- Read the Ideas Page! If you find yourself asking 'do you have any Java/Python/Fortran/x86 assembler projects...' -- you didn't read the ideas page.

The HEP Software Foundation (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing. \n\nCERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, http://www.cern.ch) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as CERN-SFT group that provides common software for CERN's experiments. This year the program has expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator  http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments have announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: detector and accelerator simulation (Falcon, Geant4, GeantV, Pythia, SixTrack), data analysis (ROOT, TMVA, scikit-HEP, Go-HEP), event reconstruction (CMS Tracking), data management (transfer2go) and many others.

Furthermore, CLiPS is well known for its work on computational stylometry and has developed state-of-the-art technology for authorship attribution, as well as author profiling, i.e. the detection of  personality, age and gender of the author of a text, based on personal writing style. Another line of research at CLiPS focuses on computational psycholinguistics and researches psychologically plausible models of child language acquisition and bilinguality. CLiPS also researches and develops tools for biomedical text mining.\n\nOver the years, CLiPS has established a strong reputation in the application of machine learning methods on a variety of language technology problems for a wide range of languages.

This proposal focuses on using deep learning to find edited images, which can be an input into a holistic heuristic function (alongside traditional NLP methods to analyze the rest of the news source) which rates the credibility of a particular news item.\n\nIn recent years, the usage of CNNs with Automatic Image Manipulation Recognition has increased. Due to the fact CNN architecture is built to naturally learn image features rather than image modifications, many of the implementations have modified the architecture so that the Deep CNN learns what features like “smoothing” or “median filtering” looks like rather than the traditional features like “nose” or “eye”. These new sets of learned features are often good indicators of image modifications.","assignee_display_names":["Guy De Pauw","Vincent Merckx","Mike Kestemont","Walter Daelemans","Tom De Smedt"],"program_year":2017},{"id":5365156910465024,"title":"Automatic Parallel Testing Environment","subcategory":"automated-parallel-testing","organization":{"id":5010351465693184,"name":"Joomla","slug":"joomla","website_url":"https://www.joomla.org/","category":"web","contact_email":"gsoc@opensourcematters.org","mailing_list":"https://www.joomla.org/mailing-lists.html","irc_channel":"http://irc.lc/freenode/joomla/","tagline":"A free and Open Source CMS Trusted By Millions for their Websites","precis":"Joomla! is a free and open source content management system (CMS) currently responsible for powering over 3.0% of all of the internet's websites!

Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time.

There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/e6UifH3TR9p8a-8sKngoEkMHw_0yJ1ssFPNN1WH-gkUOHdRwf_qU-O5UVhN3co1AZzrI7atjqYKTtl6p-z6sKq65rRanTg","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":"http://www.r-bloggers.com/","application_instructions":"1. look for a project on\nhttps://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2017/wiki/table-of-proposed-coding-projects\n\n2.

This model is a generalization of Hidden Markov Models (HMM), which in turn is part of the Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN) family. I identified three academic works with interesting ideas and application that do not provide data and code. Replication will allow future readers to assess the credibility of the results and program improvements on top of fully working code. Ultimately, published code can be integrated into current research code (for example, for backtesting) and will be proposed as a [Case Study](http://mc-stan.org/documentation/case-studies) to the Stan Development Team.\n\nThe concept of hidden states could enrich many trading strategies. A detailed replication that provides literature review, reproducible code and solid documentation will allow future readers to implement HHMM logic into existing trading frameworks (for example for covariates, signals and benchmarks). Published code for this GSoC 2017 may be leveraged in future work to provide a generic implementation of hidden state models to already existing R Packages for trading analysis.","assignee_display_names":["Brian Peterson","Michael Weylandt"],"program_year":2017},{"id":4868890820608000,"title":"Beacon adapters","subcategory":"","organization":{"id":5450351361654784,"name":"Global Alliance for Genomics and Health","slug":"global-alliance-for-genomics-and-health","website_url":"https://genomicsandhealth.org/","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"","mailing_list":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cdrWkFMqwZ38revM3G-ROJSTeNnh-Zt2XE_DcXVxo1I/edit?usp=sharing","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"We develop open standards and tools for genomics to benefit human health.","precis":"The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health creates open standards and tools for genomics to benefit human health.","description":"The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health was formed to help accelerate the potential of genomic medicine to advance human health.

Beacon is a simple web service allowing users to query institution’s databases to determine whether they contain a genetic mutation of interest. The service accepts questions of the form: \"Do you have any genomes with an ’A’ at position 100,735 on chromosome 3?\". It responds with either yes or no, optionally providing additional metadata about the mutation. The project has gotten a lot of traction quickly — there are now over 60 implementations of the Beacon API run by 35 institutions across 6 continents of the world.\n\nInstitutions implement Beacons on top various APIs and storage technologies. The goal of this project is to allow organizations to easily wrap new APIs by creating a collection of Beacon adapters for interesting sources of data. Particular data sources will be chosen based on the status of the Beacon Project at the beginning of GSoC as well as student’s interests, and might include e.g. Cancer Gene Trust, 23andMe, Watson Analytics, Annovar or SQL.","assignee_display_names":["Patrick Magee","Miro Cupak"],"program_year":2017},{"id":6670082798256128,"title":"Beagleboard BSP projects","subcategory":"board support package","organization":{"id":4918787057909760,"name":"RTEMS Project","slug":"rtems-project","website_url":"https://www.rtems.org/","category":"operating_systems","contact_email":"gsoc@rtems.org","mailing_list":"https://devel.rtems.org/wiki/TBR/Website/RTEMSMailingLists","irc_channel":"https://devel.rtems.org/wiki/Developer/IRC","tagline":"RTEMS is a real-time operating system used around the world and in space.","precis":"RTEMS is an operating system used in satellites, particle accelerators, robots, racing motorcycles, building controls, medical devices, and more.","description":"RTEMS (Real-Time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems) is a free real-time operating system (RTOS) designed for deeply embedded systems such as automobile electronics, robotic controllers, and on-board satellite instruments. \n\nRTEMS is free open source software that supports multi-processor systems for over a dozen CPU architectures and over 150 specific system boards.

The HEP Software Foundation (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing. \n\nCERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, http://www.cern.ch) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as CERN-SFT group that provides common software for CERN's experiments. This year the program has expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator  http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments have announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: detector and accelerator simulation (Falcon, Geant4, GeantV, Pythia, SixTrack), data analysis (ROOT, TMVA, scikit-HEP, Go-HEP), event reconstruction (CMS Tracking), data management (transfer2go) and many others.

Jupyter notebook offers a convenient platform for interactive data analysis, scientific computing and rapid prototyping of code. A powerful tool used to perform complex computation intensive tasks is Apache Spark. Spark is a framework for large scale cluster computing in Big Data contexts. This project aims to leverage these existing big data tools for use in an interactive scientific analysis environment. Currently Spark jobs can be called from Jupyter Notebook using the pySpark module. However to know what is happening to a running job, it is required to connect separately to the Spark server. This project aims to develop a plugin to monitor jobs sent from a notebook application, from within the notebook itself. The plugin will have features to monitor tasks, stop ongoing jobs and detect errors. ROOT is a data analysis framework, widely used in the scientific community at CERN. The plugin designed will be used to monitor processing of ROOT objects using Spark. The plugin will also be used to monitor distributed machine learning tasks.","assignee_display_names":["Danilo Piparo","Prasanth Kothuri","Enric Tejedor","Kacper Surdy"],"program_year":2017},{"id":5391620894621696,"title":"bigPint: Big multivariate data plotted interactively","subcategory":"visualization","organization":{"id":4947241283354624,"name":"R project for statistical computing","slug":"r-project-for-statistical-computing","website_url":"https://www.r-project.org/","category":"languages","contact_email":"gsoc-r@googlegroups.com","mailing_list":"https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2017/wiki","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics","precis":"R provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible.

It follows the\nstandard typing rules that programmers already know, and it fits into\ntheir workflow.  We have created around 20 [new type\nsystems](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#introduction), and other\npeople have created [many\nmore](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#third-party-checkers).\n\nThe Checker Framework is popular:  it is successfully used on hundreds\nof projects at Google, on Wall Street, and in other companies from big\nto small.  It it attractive to programmers who care about their craft\nand the quality of their code.  The Checker Framework is the\nmotivation for Java's type annotations feature.  Talks on it have\nreceived multiple awards at conferences such as JavaOne.  With this\nwidespread use, there is a need for people to help with the project:\neverything from bug fixes, to new features, to case studies, to IDE\nintegration.

It can be used to power Instant Messaging, VoIP/WebRTC signalling, Internet of Things communication - or anywhere you need a standard HTTP API for publishing and subscribing to data whilst tracking the conversation history.\n\n[Matrix.org](https://matrix.org) defines the standard, and provides open source reference implementations of Matrix-compatible Servers, Clients, Client SDKs and Application Services to help you create new communication solutions or extend the capabilities and reach of existing ones.\n\n# What is Matrix’s Mission?\nMatrix’s initial goal is to fix the problem of fragmented IP communications: letting users message and call each other without having to care what app the other user is on - making it as easy as sending an email.\n\nThe longer term goal is for Matrix to act as a generic HTTP messaging and data synchronisation system for the whole web - allowing people, services and devices to easily communicate with each other securely, and empowering users to own and control their data and select the services and vendors they want to use.\n\n# What does this mean for users?\nThe aim is to provide an analogous ecosystem to email - one where you can communicate with pretty much anyone, without caring what app or server they are using, using whichever app & server you chose to use, and use a neutral identity system like an e-mail address or phone number to discover people to talk to.\n\n# How is Matrix currently being used?\n[Lots of different clients](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html) have already been written by the community, as well as several bridges to exiting services (IRC, Slack, libpurple etc). In fact, a user visiting #matrix on freenode might be communicating with libpurple or Slack users via Matrix - without even realising it!\n\nWe have recently added end-to-end encryption to Matrix.

It finds common programming flaws, sub-optimal code and code style issues in multiple languages. For example, it can highlight unused variables, empty catch blocks or too complex code, just to name a few.\n\n# Programming Languages\n\nInitially PMD started out to be a Java-only code analyzer. But nowadays, it fully supports 7 languages: Java, JavaScript, Salesforce.com Apex, PLSQL, Apache Velocity, XML and XSL. All languages provide many rules, that you can immediately use to check your source code.\n\n# Copy-Paste-Detector\n\nAdditionally it includes CPD, the copy-paste-detector. CPD finds duplicated code in Java, C, C++, C#, Groovy, PHP, Ruby, Fortran, JavaScript, PLSQL, Apache Velocity, Scala, Objective C, Matlab, Python, Go, Swift and Salesforce.com Apex.\n\n# Usage\n\nPMD has over 50000 monthly downloads and is actively used by many open source and closed source projects. It is integrated into most common build tools like Maven, Gradle and Ant, but it can also be used from the command line. Integrations into CI systems such as Jenkins can provide comparisons between builds to see quality improvements or degradation over time based on the issues found by PMD. When integrated into the build, PMD can serve as a quality gate.\n\n# Extensibility\n\nPMD comes out of the box with many rules in the area of code design, optimizations, naming and many more. It provides a flexible infrastructure to customize the existing rules via properties and to define completely new custom rules. The rules can be organized in rulesets, which can be shared within a software project, so that every developer is using the same PMD configuration.\n\nAn innovative approach allows to define PMD rules using a single XPath expression, allowing developers to do so without having to write code or deal with PMD internals. PMD ships with a designer tool to help build and test such expressions. More complex rules can be coded in Java using a visitor pattern over the analyzed code.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 2-Clause \"Simplified\" or \"FreeBSD\" License (BSD-2-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/0zUjNivx8xXksXcpfGUl7E-imy1NLNZKjknPdVpCP3r9oX9SVXk3u4JsWJd2JM02PwMQDvvgq-LUjrmm9oIEtnMaSXjDhVE","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"1.

Zulip also supports fast search, drag-and-drop file uploads, image previews, group private messages, audible notifications, missed-message emails, desktop apps, and [much more](https://www.zulip.org).\n\nZulip has gained a considerable amount of traction [since Dropbox released it as open source software in September 2015](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2015/09/open-sourcing-zulip-a-dropbox-hack-week-project/), and is gaining more users at a rapid pace -- every day, at least tens of thousands of people use Zulip. Your work on Zulip will have impact on the daily experiences of a huge number of people.\n\nAs an organization, we value high-quality mentorship and making sure our product quality is extremely high -- you can expect to learn a lot how to make a large software project successful from disciplined code reviews by highly experienced engineers. Since Zulip is a group chat product, your GSoC experience with the Zulip project will be highly interactive (often collaborating with developers over chat to solve tricky problems), with a real focus on teaching you the concepts and reasoning behind how Zulip is engineered and how to make it better.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/4QMZsEPNQGKdGyU35C4SdDK6FeyuTwdeErPxqrt1E3WTja3Q0pTmMVp0fTYfaZpSwATBhoVSQXUYzbJ9MgI-5fMIq7mHMxg","image_bg_color":"7e98ad","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"http://twitter.com/zuliposs","blog_url":"https://blog.zulip.org/","application_instructions":"We have application instructions at [our ideas page](https://github.com/zulip/zulip.github.io/blob/master/gsoc-ideas.md#application-tips-and-how-to-be-a-strong-candidate), along with tips on how to be a strong candidate.\n\nThe best applicants are those who take an ownership mentality with the part of the project that they're working on: finding and reporting bugs, reviewing others' code, carefully testing their work when they fix issues to ensure they don't cause other problems, carefully explaining their changes with clear variable names, comments, and commit messages, and helping other contributors with their work, just like the maintainer of an open source project would.","topic_tags":["enterprise","web development","group chat","cross-platform","mobile applications"],"technology_tags":["python","django","javascript","react native","electron"],"proposal_tags":["mobile","performance","integration","automated testing","apis","desktop","javascript","user experience","emoji","analytics"],"ideas_list":"https://github.com/zulip/zulip.github.io/blob/master/gsoc-ideas.md","contact_method":"https://chat.zulip.org/","program_year":2017},"student":{"id":5234371807150080,"display_name":"Eeshan Garg","program_year":2017},"abstract":"My proposal describes my approach of how we could implement a Zulip incoming webhook API that allows Slack to post into Zulip with the additional goal of further integrating as many of Slack's own third-party integrations as possible.","assignee_display_names":["Tomasz Kolek"],"program_year":2017},{"id":4716939514478592,"title":"Build a tool to improve crash clustering, currently based on the top method of the stack trace","subcategory":"crash analysis","organization":{"id":6421332469219328,"name":"Mozilla","slug":"mozilla","website_url":"https://www.mozilla.org/","category":"web","contact_email":"gsoc-mentors@mozilla.com","mailing_list":"","irc_channel":"https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC","tagline":"Internet for people, not profit.","precis":"We’re Mozilla, the proudly non-profit champions of the Internet, helping to keep it healthy, open and accessible to all.","description":"Our mission is to ensure the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all.

The Foundation’s mission is to promote software literacy within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology-related fields — and to make these fields accessible to diverse communities. Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.\n\nWe do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes [Processing (Java)](http://processing.org), [p5.js (JavaScript)](http://p5js.org), and [Processing.py (Python)](http://py.processing.org/), and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.\n\nThe Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or ability. We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.\n\nAt our core is the philosophy and politics of open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skillset, but is instead a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone.

The main objective of the project, called **ProvinciaWiFi** (later renamed [WiFi Metropolitano](http://www.cittametropolitanaroma.gov.it/index.php/wifimetropolitano-english-version)), was to take a decisive step to reduce the existing **digital divide** by fostering and facilitating the use of ICT by citizens.\nFrom the outset it was decided to commit the project to a completely open philosophy. For this reason a clear choice towards open software and operating systems and the availability of every modification, update and improvement to the community was made. The same approach was adopted for the knowledge and the experience acquired within the project. In order to pursue this goals the Province of Rome called the university consortium *CASPUR* (later merged in the [CINECA](https://www.cineca.it/en) consortium) to develop the technical solution. In this context, a research project conducted by the *CINECA* consortium found its perfect application. This project proposed an innovative methodology for the distribution of networks (more precisely Virtual LANs used for Wi-Fi connectivity) between geographically distant sites. \n\nThe methodology adopted made it possible to host public connectivity services on non-dedicated network infrastructures (e.g.: private xDSL) that for technical and legal reasons could not be used as such. \u2028This is not the sole advantage that OpenWISP gave to *WiFi Metropolitano*: embracing the resource-sharing philosophy – typical of open projects – anyone can contribute to the network expansion simply by hosting an access point.\n\n\u2028The software tools and the architectures, including the OpenWISP 2 [wifi controller](http://openwisp.org/whatis.html#wifi-controller) and different [NetJSON](http://netjson.org/) implementations used in OpenWISP,  are released to the public free of charge under open-source licenses, we hope this will allow a broader audience to benefit from this work and improve upon it.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/pNekwasncafkQ2pz4_5TwyxaZHDyy1AU6rHJ-FFGNzL0Fag6orGBoWECJmHQ_wxWkAb0GhFjdTzcysB7EBjQrSzJ1Pnogw0","image_bg_color":"333","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/openwisp","blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"Then send us an email with the following details:\n\n**1.

Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (http://regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (http://pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in dozens of developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and India.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/sVDHWw3LviXkpfFg0c7JL5ScXMi45mmZhrVxqaZIiwpgKR3rkb32_KaXocjw_bnoll_ePtotlYF99VjXufs9yiBxi6QGZxjQ","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/openmrs","blog_url":"http://openmrs.org/blog/","application_instructions":"Thanks for applying to OpenMRS for GSoC 2017!

The analysis of such data helps multiple types of research from being able to forecast a solar storms to detect planets in other stars, from understanding how galaxies are formed to explain the expansion and the origin of the universe.\n\nOpen Astronomy currently is formed by [eight organisations](http://openastronomy.org/members/) that develop tools for different aspects on astronomy. The range of topics covered by these projects is wide, for example: \n- [Astropy](http://astropy.org) is a general Python library for astronomy, providing common tools such as celestial coordinates, image processing, tabular data  reading and writing, units and support for astronomy-specific file formats; \n- [SunPy](http://sunpy.org) provides utilities for obtaining and representing solar physics data, with clients for some of the largest online solar physics data archives and solar specific analysis and visualisation code; \n- [Glue](http://www.glueviz.org/) is a data visualization application and library to explore relationships within and among related datasets;\n- ChiantiPy is a Python interface to the CHIANTI atomic database, which allows users to characterise the properties (temperature, density, velocity) of observed stars from spectra; \n- [Julia Astro](http://juliaastro.github.io/) is a set of packages for general astronomy and astrophysics analysis using Julia. \n- And more!\n\nAs a single organisation, we aim to strengthen collaborations between the different sub-organisations, and at the same time increase the awareness among our users on the capabilities of our \"sister\" projects.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 3-Clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License (BSD-3-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/NfYKDdBunfpzSJmItKXoW2SuvQ2uJ22VG53qStOGeGhFmsxiph5RcylIST7KAHc9GWS0RJnWTPX_C6eNWORsWptkh5juOQ","image_bg_color":"FFFFFF","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/Open_Astronomy","blog_url":"http://openastronomy.org/blog.html","application_instructions":"Do you want to participate in OpenAstronomy as part of the GSoC?

Chapel is implemented with portability in mind, permitting Chapel to run on multicore desktops and laptops, commodity clusters, and the cloud, in addition to the high-end supercomputers for which it was designed. Chapel's design and development are being led by Cray Inc. in collaboration with academia, computing centers, and industry. Chapel offers a unique experience for students to work on projects involving high-performance computing, parallel programming, and compiler development.\n\n# Core features\n\n**Native Parallelism**\n\nChapel supports parallelism at the language level. For instance, Chapel provides a \"coforall\" loop, which is similar to a \"for\" loop and creates a separate task per iteration of the loop body. These explicit parallelism features make it easier to reason about the parallelism in your algorithm and program.\n\n**Data and Task Locality**\n\nWhen working on a large machine, the location of some data relative to the task which uses it or other data with which it must work plays a key role in performance. Chapel provides features which allow you to control that placement, both within a data structure and outside it.\n\n**Multiresolution Philosophy**\n\nChapel is designed around a multiresolution philosophy, permitting users to initially write very abstract code and then incrementally add more detail until they are as close to the machine as their needs require.\n\n**Modern Language Features**\n\nChapel supports code reuse and rapid prototyping via object-oriented design, type inference, and features for generic programming.\n\n**Interoperability**\n\nExisting code from other languages can be integrated into Chapel programs (or vice-versa) via interoperability features.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ouhiO9cOmNc2otF9_uh-s1fRB4kbfn9-x9gjGtLmY2DccpHt3zWa1gUS17PrDZzpm0L1djadVeO9yOZ2501T2udHmY0LsF4","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/chapellanguage","blog_url":"https://www.facebook.com/ChapelLanguage","application_instructions":"Please see: http://chapel.cray.com/gsoc/apply.html","topic_tags":["programming languages","compilers","high performance computing","distributed computing","parallel computing"],"technology_tags":["chapel","python","high performance computing","c","c++"],"proposal_tags":["libraries and applications","compatibility","compiler","runtime","infrastructure","other"],"ideas_list":"http://chapel.cray.com/gsoc/ideas.html","contact_method":"chapel_info@cray.com","program_year":2017},"student":{"id":6009489447714816,"display_name":"Nikhil Mahendran","program_year":2017},"abstract":"‘Chapel Online’ - To built a web service that complies Chapel code and returns the result.

ChemClipse will benefit with this capability.\n \nDuring Google Summer of Code-2017, I intend to systematically introduce fundamental R capabilities to ChemClipse. My plan is to utilize RJ open source library and provide interactive console as well as scripting windows for users. I am going to additionally support it by building a prototype of GUI, for users with non-programming skills, which will be based on the pipeline laid out for interactive console window.\n\nThe users will require programming skills in R language for using interactive console. This risk can be mitigated by extending console functionalities and enhancing prototype of GUI. Thus, users not having programming skills can also benefit.","assignee_display_names":["Philip Wenig"],"program_year":2017},{"id":6663756250611712,"title":"Chukchi morphological analyser using HFST","subcategory":"","organization":{"id":5100746233085952,"name":"Apertium","slug":"apertium","website_url":"http://www.apertium.org","category":"other","contact_email":"apertium-contact@lists.sourceforge.net","mailing_list":"http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Contact","irc_channel":"http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/IRC","tagline":"Free/open-source rule-based machine translation","precis":"Apertium is a free/open-source platform for rule-based machine translation and language technology which is aimed providing support for lesser-resourced and marginalised languages.","description":"Apertium is a free/open-source machine translation platform, initially aimed at related-language pairs (such as Spanish–Catalan) but which has been expanded to deal with more divergent language pairs (such as English–Catalan and even Basque→English).

But if you have a wacky idea, we might still be interested if we can turn it into something achievable in 3 months.\r\n- Be appropriate: Demonstrate you have a knowledge of Apertium, how it works and the problem it has that you'd like to solve.\r\n- Have a plan: Three months may seem like a long time, but it isn't. Provide a weekly plan with dates and deliverables. Leave time for getting familiar with the platform — ideally before, or in the community bonding period — and for documentation. If you plan to work on a language pair, make yourself familiar with testvoc and other quality controls, and factor those in. If you know of any breaks or absences beforehand, mention them and plan around them.\r\n- Get in contact ASAP!: We get lots of proposals: only a few are good. Contact your potential mentor as soon as possible: send your proposal to the mailing list, hang out on IRC, ask for feedback, and refine your application based on feedback. If you are remembered, you are more likely to be picked.\r\n- Read the Ideas Page!

On the server side are the requests forwarded to an adapter, which processes the data.\n\nThe aim of this project is to add more cloud based file adapter’s through the Joomla plugin system for the media manager which allow the other developers to extend the capability of it. They can add a cloud file system to Joomla! which allows the users to interact with media files the same way as with local files.","assignee_display_names":["David Neukirchen","Allon Moritz"],"program_year":2017}]}
