Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer (Zenmap), a flexible data transfer, redirection, and debugging tool (Ncat), a utility for comparing scan results (Ndiff), and a packet generation and response analysis tool (Nping).","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/stca4w_DgjtaorXi6g879sAxsdEOpJcicWbOIQH5h-sboE6iuTn6piNprM18Txd3REc7D2k78QBCqUikX446f6YjsJbgLA","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":"https://plus.google.com/+nmap","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/nmap","blog_url":"http://insecure.org/","application_instructions":"First, read our [ideas page](https://nmap.org/soc/), [general requirements](https://nmap.org/soc/GeneralRequirements.html) & [application tips](https://nmap.org/soc/apply.html).

These domains include sensors, actuators, and intelligent software in between. It has been designed to help in programming such intelligent software. It is written in C++ and Python, and provides a distributed component-based programming environment where the robotic application is made up of a collection of several concurrent asynchronous components. Each component may run in different computers and they are connected using ICE communication middleware or ROS. JdeRobot is based on ROS and uses ROS drivers.\n\nReal robots like TurtleBot, drones (ArDrone, 3DR solo) and real sensors like color cameras, RGBD cameras (Kinect1, Kinect2, Xtion), RPLidar, laser are supported. And their corresponding ones in Gazebo simulator, including also a Formula1 and autonomous cars.\n\nGetting sensor measurements is as simple as calling a local function, and ordering motor commands as easy as calling another local function.

Teaching Robotics: Translation of a Scratch program to ROS python components\nScratch is a free visual programming language used in children's education, to teach them basic programming. It is composed of graphical building blocks (instructions) that must be visually connected to build the program. The idea here is to take benefit of our experience translating from a graphical description of a program in visual HFSM into a JdeRobot-ROS component to do the same with a different visual language, Scratch. The goal is to explore the use of Scratch with robots, both simulated or real, that JdeRobot-ROS allows and simplifies. We will start with simulated robots in Gazebo, despite with real robots will be the same as they use the same interfaces.\nThis project expects to develop a new tool prototype that reads Scratch programs and translate them into ROS Python components.","assignee_display_names":["L.

This year the program has expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator  http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments have announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: detector and accelerator simulation (Falcon, Geant4, GeantV, Pythia, SixTrack), data analysis (ROOT, TMVA, scikit-HEP, Go-HEP), event reconstruction (CMS Tracking), data management (transfer2go) and many others.

A series of minimal modules are meant to be bundled with the game's standard distribution to offer a sort of vanilla game experience, with a focus on commonly used systems that are often fragmented and re-implemented many times over. All such modules are community owned and maintained, guaranteed to work with every release.\n\n## Extensibility\n\nAny content is wrapped in modules ranging from tiny frameworks supporting commonly needed utility to large gameplay templates commonly referred to as mod packs in the Minecraft world, that in turn can depend on dozens of the smaller pieces, maximizing reusability.\n\nCreating a new module is as easy as running a single gradlew command, having a community repository created on GitHub is another single request away, and fetching source for any such community module is yet another single command.

This algorithm was presented by   Jonathan T. Barron and Ben Poole as an ECCV2016 oral and best paper nominee. Algorithm details and applications   can be found in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.03296.pdf [1]\n\nSignificance:\nThe naive bilateral filtering functions in OpenCV are generally computationally expensive and often insufficient for  solving more challenging computer vision tasks. By contrast, the bilateral solver is 10-1000× faster than existing  domain-specific approaches with comparable accuracy, and produces higher-quality output than lightweight filtering  techniques with comparable runtimes.","assignee_display_names":["Bo Li"],"program_year":2017},{"id":6720883738542080,"title":"The P2PSP virtual room application","subcategory":"core","organization":{"id":5717890352283648,"name":"P2PSP.org","slug":"p2psporg","website_url":"http://p2psp.org","category":"graphics","contact_email":"info@p2psp.org","mailing_list":null,"irc_channel":"https://gitter.im/P2PSP/core","tagline":"Shaping the future Internet TV","precis":"P2PSP.org is a nonprofit organization that develops the P2PSP protocol, an application layer protocol designed for the real-time streaming of multimedia content over the Internet.","description":"P2PSP.org is a nonprofit organization that develops, among other things, the P2PSP protocol.

Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nMany users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/e6UifH3TR9p8a-8sKngoEkMHw_0yJ1ssFPNN1WH-gkUOHdRwf_qU-O5UVhN3co1AZzrI7atjqYKTtl6p-z6sKq65rRanTg","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":"http://www.r-bloggers.com/","application_instructions":"1. look for a project on\nhttps://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2017/wiki/table-of-proposed-coding-projects\n\n2.

Chapel is implemented with portability in mind, permitting Chapel to run on multicore desktops and laptops, commodity clusters, and the cloud, in addition to the high-end supercomputers for which it was designed. Chapel's design and development are being led by Cray Inc. in collaboration with academia, computing centers, and industry. Chapel offers a unique experience for students to work on projects involving high-performance computing, parallel programming, and compiler development.\n\n# Core features\n\n**Native Parallelism**\n\nChapel supports parallelism at the language level. For instance, Chapel provides a \"coforall\" loop, which is similar to a \"for\" loop and creates a separate task per iteration of the loop body. These explicit parallelism features make it easier to reason about the parallelism in your algorithm and program.\n\n**Data and Task Locality**\n\nWhen working on a large machine, the location of some data relative to the task which uses it or other data with which it must work plays a key role in performance. Chapel provides features which allow you to control that placement, both within a data structure and outside it.\n\n**Multiresolution Philosophy**\n\nChapel is designed around a multiresolution philosophy, permitting users to initially write very abstract code and then incrementally add more detail until they are as close to the machine as their needs require.\n\n**Modern Language Features**\n\nChapel supports code reuse and rapid prototyping via object-oriented design, type inference, and features for generic programming.\n\n**Interoperability**\n\nExisting code from other languages can be integrated into Chapel programs (or vice-versa) via interoperability features.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/ouhiO9cOmNc2otF9_uh-s1fRB4kbfn9-x9gjGtLmY2DccpHt3zWa1gUS17PrDZzpm0L1djadVeO9yOZ2501T2udHmY0LsF4","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/chapellanguage","blog_url":"https://www.facebook.com/ChapelLanguage","application_instructions":"Please see: http://chapel.cray.com/gsoc/apply.html","topic_tags":["programming languages","compilers","high performance computing","distributed computing","parallel computing"],"technology_tags":["chapel","python","high performance computing","c","c++"],"proposal_tags":["libraries and applications","compatibility","compiler","runtime","infrastructure","other"],"ideas_list":"http://chapel.cray.com/gsoc/ideas.html","contact_method":"chapel_info@cray.com","program_year":2017},"student":{"id":6013473835188224,"display_name":"saru95","program_year":2017},"abstract":"This project aims to enable Chapel with its own module which would be a collection of both secure hash functions(such as SHA256) and various encryption algorithms(such as AES / DES / RSA/ ElGamal, etc) by using the crypto primitives of native libraries such as OpenSSL or libsodium in Chapel (libtomcrypt in our case).

The BeeWare Project aims to take the power of Python as a language, and use it to enable users of all skill levels to develop applications with native user interfaces; to do for mobile and desktop user-facing software the same thing that [Django](https://djangoproject.com) has done for web software. This means giving users a set of tools and libraries that enables them to develop rich, native user interfaces, and deploy them to their devices, including:\n\n* Tools to enable Python to run on different devices,\n* Tools to package a Python project so it can run on those devices,\n* Libraries to access the native capabilities of devices,\n* Tools to help develop, debug, and deploy these projects.\n\n# Python native\nIf Python isn't available as a first-class option on a platform, we'll do whatever is necessary to make Python available as a development language. And when we have the opportunity to embrace Python idiom for an API or a design, we're going to do just that. \n\n# Platform native\nIt's easy to use themes to achieve cross-platform. However, it's easy to spot apps that have been built using themes - they're the ones that don't behave quite like any other app. BeeWare uses native widgets and native functionality, rather than using a theme-based approach to application development. We also distribute our tools and libraries using platform-native distribution channels, such as app stores.\n\n# More than just code\nWe're not just about software, though. We also aim to be a project with a social conscience. We aim to develop and maintain a diverse and inclusive community, and we have a Code of Conduct that is rigorously enforced. We also aspire to develop a healthy and sustainable community - one that is aware of mental health issues of its participants, and provides the resources for people to start engaging, and continue to engage with the community.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"BSD 3-Clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License (BSD-3-Clause)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/q9j-rVpc9hO-RcN0qJ4FxVm7RDZZVi_lCPT_Uy-7mjKjU5bjyLT1od7cz6ndebuHnL1BledS7Up-jUfP-FN-4RpQKbviqg","image_bg_color":"eceeef","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/pybeeware","blog_url":"http://pybee.org/news/","application_instructions":"To begin the application process, open a ticket on the appropriate repository on Github.

In accordance to this trend, the proposal is an automated mode of electric transportation using a modified Dijkstra’s algorithm with concepts of Ant Colony optimization, big data analytics and cloud computing for number crunching to arrive at the destination based on the traffic and the number of drivers on the road, in the shortest time possible instead of the usual shortest distance algorithms. The analysis of the time saved by the drivers for different map types will be recorded and compared and the results will be to the time taken and energy consumption by the original Dijkstra’s algorithm. Similarly, the modified technique can be extended to other shortest path finding algorithms. The combined reduction in the distance travelled and time taken will be computed to find the best possible path and the prediction of the energy required will be made using Keras. Further, a real time navigation and notification system will be present for helping the drivers in various ways, which includes communicating with other drivers or nearby charging stations.","assignee_display_names":["Fabian Bormann","Janis Feye"],"program_year":2017},{"id":6314700494077952,"title":"Training and Topic Visualizations","subcategory":"gensim","organization":{"id":4968629817835520,"name":"NumFOCUS","slug":"numfocus","website_url":"http://www.numfocus.org/","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"gsoc@numfocus.org","mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/a/numfocus.org/forum/#!forum/gsoc","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"NumFOCUS promotes open source scientific software.","precis":"NumFOCUS supports and promotes world-class, innovative, open source scientific software.","description":"NumFOCUS supports and promotes world-class, innovative, open source scientific software.

But if you have a wacky idea, we might still be interested if we can turn it into something achievable in 3 months.\r\n- Be appropriate: Demonstrate you have a knowledge of Apertium, how it works and the problem it has that you'd like to solve.\r\n- Have a plan: Three months may seem like a long time, but it isn't. Provide a weekly plan with dates and deliverables. Leave time for getting familiar with the platform — ideally before, or in the community bonding period — and for documentation. If you plan to work on a language pair, make yourself familiar with testvoc and other quality controls, and factor those in. If you know of any breaks or absences beforehand, mention them and plan around them.\r\n- Get in contact ASAP!: We get lots of proposals: only a few are good. Contact your potential mentor as soon as possible: send your proposal to the mailing list, hang out on IRC, ask for feedback, and refine your application based on feedback. If you are remembered, you are more likely to be picked.\r\n- Read the Ideas Page!

These aren't just bug-finding tools.  Our tools give a proof, but are easy to use.","description":"We are a group of developers who are passionate about code quality.\nWe have built an innovative lightweight verification tool called the\n[Checker Framework](https://checkerframework.org/).\n\nThe Checker Framework helps you prevent bugs at development time,\nbefore they escape to production.  It is based on the idea of\n_pluggable type-checking_.  Pluggable type-checking replaces a\nprogramming language's built-in type system with a more powerful,\nexpressive one.\n\nJava's type system prevents some bugs, such as `int count =\n\"hello\";`.  However, it does not prevent other bugs, such as null\npointer dereferences, concurrency errors, disclosure of private\ninformation, incorrect internationalization, out-of-bounds indices, and\nso forth.\n\nThe Checker Framework enables you to create a more powerful type\nsystem and use it in place of Java's.  The more powerful type system\nis not just a bug-finding tool:  it is a verification tool that gives\na guarantee that no errors (of certain types) exist in your program.\nEven though it is powerful, it is easy to use.  It follows the\nstandard typing rules that programmers already know, and it fits into\ntheir workflow.  We have created around 20 [new type\nsystems](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#introduction), and other\npeople have created [many\nmore](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#third-party-checkers).\n\nThe Checker Framework is popular:  it is successfully used on hundreds\nof projects at Google, on Wall Street, and in other companies from big\nto small.  It it attractive to programmers who care about their craft\nand the quality of their code.  The Checker Framework is the\nmotivation for Java's type annotations feature.  Talks on it have\nreceived multiple awards at conferences such as JavaOne.  With this\nwidespread use, there is a need for people to help with the project:\neverything from bug fixes, to new features, to case studies, to IDE\nintegration.

LibreOffice is compatible with many file formats like Microsoft® Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. At its heart though, LibreOffice is built around an open standard, the OpenDocument Format, as its native file format.\n\nLibreOffice is developed by users who, just like you, believe in the principles of Free Software and in sharing their work with the world in non-restrictive ways. The development of LibreOffice is supported by The Document Foundation which provides the infrastructure for the project.\n\nWe believe that users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software that we distribute. While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.\n\nThough the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution & skills.\n\nThe community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations. With tons of different roles in the project, we invite everyone to join us in our work and help us to make LibreOffice known, prosper, and accessible to all.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/oKFpzxvkUYRiTW0UKnMh-BD2nvvLpS3aMuXWDlE-3qTeM0cL2Kgi9z_O0aqji79LN1qxUUsMY2SMz7BMXx_a6itPOUNTRg","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":"https://plus.google.com/+libreoffice/posts","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/libreoffice","blog_url":"https://blog.documentfoundation.org/","application_instructions":"First you should have a look at the Google Summer of Code FAQ and GSoC Student Guide.

The HEP Software Foundation (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing. \n\nCERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, http://www.cern.ch) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as CERN-SFT group that provides common software for CERN's experiments. This year the program has expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator  http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments have announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: detector and accelerator simulation (Falcon, Geant4, GeantV, Pythia, SixTrack), data analysis (ROOT, TMVA, scikit-HEP, Go-HEP), event reconstruction (CMS Tracking), data management (transfer2go) and many others.

All Monte Carlo (MC) simulations depend vitally on Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs) used to sample many distributions.\nEach LHC experiments generates 5-10 Billion sampled physics events a year using around 10^18 sampled values from PRNGs. PRNGs take 1-5% of CPU time. PRNGs used must possess very large periods, fast execution, the ability to create a large number of streams, and very good correlation properties between streams and sampled values. It must be possible to reproduce a simulated event any time, for reexamination or debugging.\nThe transition from event-level parallelism in Geant4 to dynamical multithreading in GeantV requires associating the random generator states not with the threads but with the tracks, which are shuffled between \"baskets\" based on their type and energy. Maintaining reproducibility after such transition requires a drastic change in the way the random generators are used. We suggest solutions based on Scalable Pseudo Random Number Generators and on pedigrees introduced in CilkPlus, which are first tested in Geant4.","assignee_display_names":["Sandro Wenzel","John Apostolakis"],"program_year":2017},{"id":4641651556352000,"title":"Utilizing full power from BeagleBoard via usage of RTEMS on top of DSP cores","subcategory":"board support package","organization":{"id":4918787057909760,"name":"RTEMS Project","slug":"rtems-project","website_url":"https://www.rtems.org/","category":"operating_systems","contact_email":"gsoc@rtems.org","mailing_list":"https://devel.rtems.org/wiki/TBR/Website/RTEMSMailingLists","irc_channel":"https://devel.rtems.org/wiki/Developer/IRC","tagline":"RTEMS is a real-time operating system used around the world and in space.","precis":"RTEMS is an operating system used in satellites, particle accelerators, robots, racing motorcycles, building controls, medical devices, and more.","description":"RTEMS (Real-Time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems) is a free real-time operating system (RTOS) designed for deeply embedded systems such as automobile electronics, robotic controllers, and on-board satellite instruments. \n\nRTEMS is free open source software that supports multi-processor systems for over a dozen CPU architectures and over 150 specific system boards.

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is DNA that has escaped from tumor cells and is free-floating in the bloodstream, meaning that genetic information about the developing tumor can be obtained without the need to invasively extract tumor tissue. cBioPortal wants to display the insights obtained from these “liquid biopsies” onto their existing Patient View page. I propose to create a global view of ctDNA information by modifying their existing Genomic Overview to display allele frequencies, allowing users to identify at a glance mutated genes of interest. Mutated genes can be tracked by clicking on the gene, which would display a plot of the gene’s mutation concentration over time. A heatmap of selected genes can also be generated to monitor tumor heterogeneity over time. Another feature could consist of plots to track whether a mutated gene produces a differential time to relapse or survival time compared to the unaltered gene. By visualizing ctDNA results on the cBioPortal interface, I can participate in adding an exciting new clinician tool for personalized cancer genomics.","assignee_display_names":["JJ Gao","inodb","Pieter Lukasse"],"program_year":2017},{"id":6484681615736832,"title":"Visualizing constructs in cluster algebras and quiver representations","subcategory":"algebra","organization":{"id":5790079692832768,"name":"Sage Mathematical Software System","slug":"sagemath","website_url":"http://www.sagemath.org","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"harald.schilly+gsoc@gmail.com","mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/group/sage-gsoc/","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"open source math software","precis":"SageMath is an open-source mathematical software.","description":"SageMath combines numerous open-source software libraries under one umbrella and contains many unique and novice algorithms built on  top of those libraries.

Its core mission is to provide individuals and small studios with a complete, reliable, fully open rendering package.\n\nOver the years appleseed has been used on several projects including [TV documentaries](https://vimeo.com/81199785), ads, promotional videos and [an animation short](http://www.fetchaveryshortfilm.com/).\n\n# Paradigm\n\nappleseed implements a modern workflow based on path tracing that enables artifact-free, single pass rendering with very little technical tuning. It is simultaneously capable of strictly unbiased rendering when total accuracy matters, and biased rendering when artistic freedom and shorter rendering time are paramount.\n\n# Features\n\nappleseed supports fully programmable shading via [Sony Pictures Imageworks' Open Shading Language](https://github.com/imageworks/OpenShadingLanguage) (OSL), RGB/spectral/mixed rendering, fast and robust transformation and deformation motion blur, state-of-the-art ray traced subsurface scattering, exhaustive Python and C++ APIs and many other production-oriented features.\n\n# Ecosystem\n\nAlong with the core renderer, the team is actively developing high quality integrations into Autodesk Maya and Autodesk 3ds Max. appleseed is also the default rendering engine of [Image Engine’s Gaffer](http://www.gafferhq.org/).\n\n# Timeline\n\nappleseed was founded in May 2009 by François Beaune, a former rendering engineer from the core R&D team at mental images (now NVIDIA).\n\nIn October 2011, the development of appleseed benefited from a technology sharing agreement with Jupiter Jazz Limited and received funding for one year.

During my work I will investigate different approaches of visualizing volumes, select the techniques that are modern, efficient and fit the best to the existing path tracing code of appleseed, and then implement the chosen methods.

High-quality audio combined with a fully open license should be valued by the open source community as an alternative to codecs that require a patent license for encoding or payments in order to legally stream.\n\nHowever, FFmpeg’s native vorbis encoder is currently labeled as experimental or broken due to its relatively poor performance and audio quality in comparison to competing audio codecs. It serves only to output a valid bitstream, with little concern about quality. This project aims to improve the general performance of the encoder, bringing it closer to a viable status. This will be done by integrating features of the existing AAC psychoacoustic model system within the native Vorbis encoder and adapting the FFmpeg Vorbis decoder to utilize that new information.

Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.\n\nWe do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes [Processing (Java)](http://processing.org), [p5.js (JavaScript)](http://p5js.org), and [Processing.py (Python)](http://py.processing.org/), and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.\n\nThe Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or ability. We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.\n\nAt our core is the philosophy and politics of open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skillset, but is instead a creative and exploratory process.

CMS is a PHP based application that powers about 3.4% of the web, 9.7% of all CMS based websites, as well as many intranets. \n+ The Joomla! Platform is a PHP application framework used for building web and command line applications, and is the basis of the Joomla! CMS.   \n\nEach of these projects has hundreds of contributors, a set of working groups, and a leadership group. These are coordinated by the Production Leadership Team. This is an umbrella application for the two projects.\n\nThe Joomla! CMS and Joomla! Platform are community driven FOSS projects developed and maintained by an international community encompassing over 200 countries. Joomla! is used by millions of websites and web applications ranging from the hobbyist, professional web developer, to large enterprises, for both the World Wide Web and intranets.\n\nThe Joomla project is a community effort which strives to engage contributors from diverse backgrounds and varying interests and skills in building and supporting great software together.

It helps add other dimensions to the power of websites for example: a new website can sell their articles for other developers as APIs, also they can use Joomla! API to build a mobile application for their news and articles to help them reach more audiences.\nAs Joomla is one of the most famous CMSs in the world, with millions of websites that use it, It would be great that Joomla have the capability to provide APIs for websites owners.\n\nThis project is to provide a REST interface for Joomla 4. As discussed by the mentors, it would be a stand alone web app that integrates with Joomla CMS extensions. This app will be built using Joomla! Framework as it’s a tool developed and managed by Joomla team and also Joomla 4 is coming with it.\n\nI’m thinking of the app as two parts, request and response handling. The request will be routed by the app router to reach the corresponding components and retrieve the data related to the user’s request. The response is when the component receives the request from the router, it will run its logic to respond to that request and then serialize the response to follow the REST specifications.","assignee_display_names":["George Wilson","Anibal Sanchez","Michael Babker","Matías Aguirre"],"program_year":2017},{"id":5655093650128896,"title":"Webapp generator as microservice","subcategory":"javascript","organization":{"id":5640848839540736,"name":"FOSSASIA","slug":"fossasia","website_url":"http://fossasia.org","category":"other","contact_email":"fossasia@googlegroups.com","mailing_list":"http://groups.google.com/group/fossasia","irc_channel":"http://blog.fossasia.org/contact/","tagline":"Improve People's Lives","precis":"FOSSASIA is the premier Free and Open Source technology organization in Asia for developers, designers, start-ups, and contributors.","description":"FOSSASIA is the premier Free and Open Source technology organization in Asia for developers, designers, start-ups, and contributors.
