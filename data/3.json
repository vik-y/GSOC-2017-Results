At CloudCV, we are building tools that enables researchers to build, compare and share start-of-the-algorithms. We believe that one shouldn’t have to be an AI expert to have access to cutting edge vision algorithms. Likewise, researchers shouldn’t have to worry about building a service around their deep learning models to showcase and share it with others.  \n\nCloudCV consists of three major platforms: \n\n**Origami** is a AI-as-a-service solution that allows researchers to easily convert their deep learning models into an online service that is widely accessible to everyone without the need to setup the infrastructure, resolve the dependencies, and build a web service around the deep learning model. By lowering the barrier to entry to latest AI algorithms, we provide developers, researchers and students the ability to access any model using a simple REST API call.\n\n**Fabrik** is an online collaborative platform to build, visualize and train deep learning models by a simple drag-and-drop approach. It allow researchers to collaboratively develop and debug models using a web GUI that allows importing, editing and exporting networks from widely popular frameworks like Caffe and Keras.\n\n**EvalAI** is an evaluation server that will host AI challenges like Visual Question Answering, Image Captioning. In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to compare an algorithm solving a given task with other existing approaches. These comparisons suffer from minor differences in algorithm implementation, use of non-standard dataset splits and different evaluation metrics. By providing a central leaderboard and submission interface, we make it easier for researchers to reproduce the results mentioned in the paper and perform reliable & accurate quantitative analysis.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 3.0 (GPL-3.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/kL1VyMKkoJl04xEQV0yoQOfBXCpHUZgpZrC9Ta0Cq7PD6NwoGcXCNCeCz2IVyBgkXjxy9rrN_CjdLxsUXy0JV8M4HP0nfhY","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"","blog_url":"","application_instructions":"Follow these general steps to apply to our organization.\n\n**Join the CloudCV google groups / gitter channel and introduce yourself.**    \nhttps://gitter.im/Cloud-CV    \nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cloudcv\n\nNot only do we get to know you, but you can get feedback on project ideas and get help as you start working with our codebase.

It allows users to analyse projects containing multiple languages with just one tool, using just one configuration and seeing just one user interface.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nWith coala, you create just one configuration file. It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code,  find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines.\nAll controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\n\n## For Users\n\ncoala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool.\nBesides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system.

It works as:\n\n- a mailing list\n- a discussion forum\n- a long-form chat room\n\n### What’s different about it?\n\nDiscourse is a from-scratch reboot, an attempt to reimagine what a modern Internet discussion platform should be today, in a world of ubiquitous smartphones, tablets, Facebook, and Twitter.\n\n### We’re civilized.\n\nOur unique \"trust levels\" system means that the community builds a natural immune system to defend itself from trolls, bad actors, and spammers — and the most engaged community members can assist in the governance of their community. We put a trash can on every street corner with a simple, low-friction flagging system. Positive behaviors are encouraged through likes and badges. We gently, constantly educate members in a just-in-time manner on the universal rules of civilized discourse.\n\n### Uncompromisingly open source.\n\nThere is only one version of Discourse – the awesome open source version. There’s no super secret special paid commercial version with better or more complete features. Because Discourse is 100% open source, now and forever, it belongs to you as much as it belongs to us. That’s how community works.\n\nEverything that most communities would want is included out of the box; a giant collection of complex plugins should not be required to have a great experience.\n\n### Further reading:\n\n- https://www.discourse.org/faq/\n- http://www.discourse.org/faq/customers/\n- https://blog.discourse.org/2017/02/discourses-fourth-birthday/\n- https://blog.discourse.org/2017/01/discourse-1-7-released/\n- https://meta.discourse.org/","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/71wwarEm9iegPe-Eo08gEqcB9YthMDXXk1rogWwFoCXmqQVJTlLnKPrcNherWfX5L9nVvdowbWx3wnls5BCm50xrs_D55egb","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/discourse","blog_url":"http://blog.discourse.org","application_instructions":"*   **Are you joining for the right reasons?** Read “[Reasons why you shouldn’t hack on open source projects](http://blog.codecombat.com/reasons-why-you-shouldnt-hack-on-open-source-projects)” AND \"[The ideal GSoC applicant](http://blog.discourse.org/2016/03/the-ideal-gsoc-applicant/)\" carefully.

I like the fact that Discourse is not only built on solid technical foundation, but also on social values implemented through features such as ‘trust levels’. In our increasingly connected world, full of social media and internet-connected devices, it is important for systems to be interlinked to provide the best user experience. Providing links between Discourse’s ‘long format’ discussion and instant-messaging applications is a natural way to promote real-time engagement with users. The discourse-slack plugin implements this well, and extending this functionality to more providers can only increase user engagement. This needs to be done in a maintainable way and creating a ‘common event system’ for chatroom plugins is the best way to do this.","assignee_display_names":["Régis Hanol"],"program_year":2017},{"id":4923803856535552,"title":"Common Print Dialog","subcategory":"printing","organization":{"id":5142442044030976,"name":"The Linux Foundation","slug":"the-linux-foundation","website_url":"http://www.linuxfoundation.org/","category":"operating_systems","contact_email":"till@linux.com","mailing_list":"https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/gsoc/google-summer-code-2017#if-you-have-questions","irc_channel":"https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/gsoc/google-summer-code-2017#if-you-have-questions","tagline":"A non-profit consortium dedicated to fostering the growth of Linux","precis":"The Linux Foundation is a non-profit consortium dedicated to fostering the growth of Linux.

It's used to make many of the websites and applications you use every day. Drupal has great standard features, like easy content authoring, reliable performance, and excellent security. But what sets it apart is its flexibility; modularity is one of its core principles. Its tools help you build the versatile, structured content that dynamic web experiences need. It's also a great choice for creating integrated digital frameworks. You can extend it with any one, or many, of thousands of add-ons. Modules expand Drupal's functionality. Themes let you customize your content's presentation. Distributions are packaged Drupal bundles you can use as starter-kits. Mix and match these components to enhance Drupal's core abilities. Or, integrate Drupal with external services and other applications in your infrastructure. No other content management software is this powerful and scalable. The Drupal project is open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. It's distributed under the terms of the GNU (GPL). There are no licensing fees, ever. Drupal will always be free. The Drupal community is one of the largest open source communities in the world. We're more than 1,000,000 passionate developers, designers, trainers, strategists, coordinators, editors, and sponsors working together. We build Drupal, provide support, create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit pushes the Drupal project forward. New members are always welcome. Drupal 8 is the biggest update in Drupal's history. Creating content is easier. Every built-in theme is responsively designed. It's available in 100 languages, and its integration tools make it a great hub for complex ecosystems.

It finds common programming flaws, sub-optimal code and code style issues in multiple languages. For example, it can highlight unused variables, empty catch blocks or too complex code, just to name a few.\n\n# Programming Languages\n\nInitially PMD started out to be a Java-only code analyzer. But nowadays, it fully supports 7 languages: Java, JavaScript, Salesforce.com Apex, PLSQL, Apache Velocity, XML and XSL. All languages provide many rules, that you can immediately use to check your source code.\n\n# Copy-Paste-Detector\n\nAdditionally it includes CPD, the copy-paste-detector. CPD finds duplicated code in Java, C, C++, C#, Groovy, PHP, Ruby, Fortran, JavaScript, PLSQL, Apache Velocity, Scala, Objective C, Matlab, Python, Go, Swift and Salesforce.com Apex.\n\n# Usage\n\nPMD has over 50000 monthly downloads and is actively used by many open source and closed source projects. It is integrated into most common build tools like Maven, Gradle and Ant, but it can also be used from the command line. Integrations into CI systems such as Jenkins can provide comparisons between builds to see quality improvements or degradation over time based on the issues found by PMD. When integrated into the build, PMD can serve as a quality gate.\n\n# Extensibility\n\nPMD comes out of the box with many rules in the area of code design, optimizations, naming and many more. It provides a flexible infrastructure to customize the existing rules via properties and to define completely new custom rules. The rules can be organized in rulesets, which can be shared within a software project, so that every developer is using the same PMD configuration.\n\nAn innovative approach allows to define PMD rules using a single XPath expression, allowing developers to do so without having to write code or deal with PMD internals. PMD ships with a designer tool to help build and test such expressions.

Removing these occlusions and further recovering the occluded background are desirable for camera users. \n\nThe current process to remove occlusions in OpenCV is to first create a manual mask corresponding to the occlusions, and then to apply “inpaint()” function on the mask regions. However, current “inpaint()” function in OpenCV 2 can only deal with thin occlusions, such as scratches, since it is based only on the surrounding information around the masks. Recently, an exemplar-based searching method was implemented in OpenCV 3. This method replaces the occlusions with the most similar patch searched from the whole image. Although it can fill in large occlusions, it usually generates a merely plausible output instead of the true background behind the occlusions. \n\nTo further improve the inpaint function in OpenCV library, I would like to implement a more advanced method proposed in Siggraph 2015. This method is one of the state-of-art methods to be able to remove various occlusions and reflections and outperforms other methods in the authors' experiments.","assignee_display_names":["Gary Bradski"],"program_year":2017},{"id":5267404400623616,"title":"Computational Philosophy","subcategory":"computational philosophy","organization":{"id":4724897470218240,"name":"AOSSIE - Australian Open Source Software Innovation and Education","slug":"aossie-australian-open-source-software-innovation-and-education","website_url":"http://www.aossie.org/","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"","mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/aossie-gsoc-2017","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"Umbrella Org for Open-Source Projects in Australia","precis":"The umbrella organization for open-source projects developed in Australia.","description":"We are a not-for-profit umbrella organization for open-source projects developed in Australia.

Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nMany users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/e6UifH3TR9p8a-8sKngoEkMHw_0yJ1ssFPNN1WH-gkUOHdRwf_qU-O5UVhN3co1AZzrI7atjqYKTtl6p-z6sKq65rRanTg","image_bg_color":null,"gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":"http://www.r-bloggers.com/","application_instructions":"1. look for a project on\nhttps://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2017/wiki/table-of-proposed-coding-projects\n\n2.

Among different types of deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks have been most extensively studied. Due to the lack of training data and computing power in early days, it is hard to train a large high-capacity convolutional neural network without overfitting. After the rapid growth in the amount of the annotated data and the recent improvements in the strengths of graphics processor units, the research on convolutional neural networks has been emerged swiftly and achieved state-of-the-art results on various tasks. GPUs are much more effective in utilizing parallelism and pipelining than general purpose CPUs, as they are designed for high performance rendering where repeated operations are common.

It's also a great choice for creating integrated digital frameworks. You can extend it with any one, or many, of thousands of add-ons. Modules expand Drupal's functionality. Themes let you customize your content's presentation. Distributions are packaged Drupal bundles you can use as starter-kits. Mix and match these components to enhance Drupal's core abilities. Or, integrate Drupal with external services and other applications in your infrastructure. No other content management software is this powerful and scalable. The Drupal project is open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. It's distributed under the terms of the GNU (GPL). There are no licensing fees, ever. Drupal will always be free. The Drupal community is one of the largest open source communities in the world. We're more than 1,000,000 passionate developers, designers, trainers, strategists, coordinators, editors, and sponsors working together.

But if you have a wacky idea, we might still be interested if we can turn it into something achievable in 3 months.\r\n- Be appropriate: Demonstrate you have a knowledge of Apertium, how it works and the problem it has that you'd like to solve.\r\n- Have a plan: Three months may seem like a long time, but it isn't. Provide a weekly plan with dates and deliverables. Leave time for getting familiar with the platform — ideally before, or in the community bonding period — and for documentation. If you plan to work on a language pair, make yourself familiar with testvoc and other quality controls, and factor those in. If you know of any breaks or absences beforehand, mention them and plan around them.\r\n- Get in contact ASAP!: We get lots of proposals: only a few are good. Contact your potential mentor as soon as possible: send your proposal to the mailing list, hang out on IRC, ask for feedback, and refine your application based on feedback. If you are remembered, you are more likely to be picked.\r\n- Read the Ideas Page! If you find yourself asking 'do you have any Java/Python/Fortran/x86 assembler projects...' -- you didn't read the ideas page.

However, applying known algorithms may not be enough every time to extract the useful information. Some specialized queries may be helpful in this sence to extract more useful or more specific information. Actually, these types of queries are already implemented inside the PATIKAweb software that is a result of the study done by Doğrusöz et al. in Java programming language. The aim of this project is to move these implementations into the common use of developers by making an extension to Cytoscape.js, which is a commonly used graph drawing library written in Javascript. Cytoscape.js already includes some basic graph traversal algorithms such as DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Kruskal etc., but I believe that these specialized queries will provide a good functionality to be used in not only in biological networks, but also in other types of networks. With the advantage of compound node support in Cytoscape.js, these specialized traversal algorithms will also be easily applied to the large networks with compound node content.","assignee_display_names":["Ozgun Babur"],"program_year":2017},{"id":5178892366118912,"title":"cyTRON: a Cytoscape app for the visualization of evolutionary trajectories in cancer progression","subcategory":"cytoscape app","organization":{"id":4702232323817472,"name":"National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB)","slug":"national-resource-for-network-biology-nrnb","website_url":"http://www.nrnb.org/gsoc.html","category":"science_and_medicine","contact_email":"alex.pico@gladstone.ucsf.edu","mailing_list":"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cytoscape-helpdesk","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"Developing open source software to enable network-based biomedical discovery","precis":"The National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB) organizes the development of free, open source software to enable network-based visualization, analysis, and biomedical discovery.","description":"The [National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB)](http://www.nrnb.org) organizes the development of free, open source software technologies to enable network-based visualization, analysis, and biomedical discovery.

It quickly became and remains one of the most important reference databases in genomics, following the rapid development of the field. Its initial mission included finding all of the genes in the human genome. A year later, the mouse genome was published and we developed tools to directly compare genomes across species. Over the following decade, sequencing capacity increased exponentially (faster that Moore's Law in fact) and large surveys started examining more species and more individuals within each species. Our mission therefore expanded to store these datasets and statistics efficiently. Finally, in recent years, sequencing has been used to study the biochemical activity of the DNA molecule within the different tissues of an individual, prompting us to extend yet again our remit.\n\nAt the same time, Ensembl is an evolving software development project. Over 15 years, we moved from a central relational MySQL database with a Perl API and static web pages, to an array of storage technologies with a RESTful interface and an interactive front-end. We have dedicated portals for the large clades on the tree of life (known as Ensembl Genomes). Our annotations are produced through centuries of CPU time, coordinated by our powerful eHive analysis workflow manager.\n\nToday, we are a team of nearly 60 full time staff, housed at the European Bioinformatics Institute, and we collaborate with many external contributors around the world, in particular via our Github repositories where you can see us work day-to-day.

This year the program has expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator  http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments have announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: detector and accelerator simulation (Falcon, Geant4, GeantV, Pythia, SixTrack), data analysis (ROOT, TMVA, scikit-HEP, Go-HEP), event reconstruction (CMS Tracking), data management (transfer2go) and many others.

These domains include sensors, actuators, and intelligent software in between. It has been designed to help in programming such intelligent software. It is written in C++ and Python, and provides a distributed component-based programming environment where the robotic application is made up of a collection of several concurrent asynchronous components. Each component may run in different computers and they are connected using ICE communication middleware or ROS. JdeRobot is based on ROS and uses ROS drivers.\n\nReal robots like TurtleBot, drones (ArDrone, 3DR solo) and real sensors like color cameras, RGBD cameras (Kinect1, Kinect2, Xtion), RPLidar, laser are supported. And their corresponding ones in Gazebo simulator, including also a Formula1 and autonomous cars.\n\nGetting sensor measurements is as simple as calling a local function, and ordering motor commands as easy as calling another local function.

This project is about developing a converter which will convert spatial SBML models with different spatial geometries.","assignee_display_names":["Akira Funahashi"],"program_year":2017},{"id":6706031882141696,"title":"Develop a set of Jupyter Notebooks for the Kubernetes Python Client + Kubernetes Python Client update","subcategory":"kubernetes","organization":{"id":6540924424290304,"name":"Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)","slug":"cloud-native-computing-foundation-cncf","website_url":"https://www.cncf.io/","category":"cloud","contact_email":"info@cncf.io","mailing_list":"https://www.cncf.io/community","irc_channel":"http://slack.cncf.io/","tagline":"The CNCF is a nonprofit committed to the development of cloud native technology","precis":"The CNCF is a open source nonprofit foundation committed to the development of cloud native technology and hosts projects such as Kubernetes, Prometheus and Fluentd.","description":"The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is a nonprofit organization committed to advancing the development of cloud native technology and services by creating a new set of common container technologies informed by technical merit and end user value, and inspired by Internet-scale computing.

Many SBOL-compliant tools already exist which perform distinct and useful functions ranging from component design, modeling, composition, simulation, figure creation, storage, sharing, and publication. In 2016, ACS Synthetic Biology recommended that all authors submit genetic designs using SBOL. An example workflow for doing so was published in 2016 (Hillson), and each of the parts of the workflow can be fulfilled by extant tools, but the integrations between tools can be made more robust.  For example, the SynBioHub service allows for storage and sharing of SBOL parts, VisBOL allows for creation of SBOL visual images from SBOL files, and iBioSim and SBOL Designer allow for creation and composition of SBOL parts. SBOL Designer and iBioSim allow for upload of parts to an instance of SynBioHub, but there are many opportunities to improve this workflow with authentication, security, and sharing capabilities.","assignee_display_names":["Anil Wipat"],"program_year":2017},{"id":5458070078488576,"title":"Develop a test framework for checking FreeType's rendering output","subcategory":"qa control","organization":{"id":6412376791318528,"name":"The FreeType Project","slug":"the-freetype-project","website_url":"http://freetype.org","category":"graphics","contact_email":null,"mailing_list":"https://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/freetype-devel","irc_channel":null,"tagline":"FreeType font rendering library","precis":"FreeType is a freely available software library to render fonts.","description":"FreeType is a freely available software library to render fonts.\n\nIt is written in C, designed to be small, efficient, highly customizable, and portable while capable of producing high-quality output (glyph images) of most vector and bitmap font formats.\n\nSome products that use FreeType for rendering fonts on screen or on paper, either exclusively or partially:\n\n* GNU/Linux and other free Unix operating system derivates like FreeBSD or NetBSD;\n* iOS, Apple's mobile operating system for iPhones and iPads;\n* Android, Google's operating system for smartphones and tablet computers;\n* ChromeOS, Google's operating system for laptop computers;\n* ReactOS, a free open source operating system based on the best design principles       found in the Windows NT architecture;\n* Ghostscript, a PostScript interpreter used in many printers.\n\nCounting the above products only, you get more than a *billion* devices that contain FreeType.","tags":[],"primary_open_source_license":"GNU General Public License version 2.0 (GPL-2.0)","image_url":"//lh3.googleusercontent.com/mIIR_ObFs5CYv7MFO63kM8u7WA39cA-oP-J9aTmMSAGBqHz_f8Jd9gSRCKY8DYBEwSTvTRgCv3TaG35RrmU80Q8ZENzCYw","image_bg_color":"","gplus_url":null,"twitter_url":null,"blog_url":null,"application_instructions":"If you are interested in one of the ideas, please write an e-mail to <freetype-devel@nongnu.org>!\n\nPrerequisites are the ability to understand the C programming language, and good knowledge of the standard tools to configure and compile a library in a Unix environment, in particular GNU make, autoconf, and libtool.","topic_tags":["fonts","opentype","rendering","graphics","truetype"],"technology_tags":["fonts","opentype","c","library"],"proposal_tags":["new feature","qa control","fuzzing"],"ideas_list":"https://www.freetype.org/gsoc.html","contact_method":"https://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/freetype-devel","program_year":2017},"student":{"id":5687360458063872,"display_name":"Arvinder Bhathal","program_year":2017},"abstract":"The process of fixing bugs in, or adding features to FreeType may result in regressions that alter the appearance of glyph images.

FEniCS has always supported meshes consisting of simplex cells (e.g. triangles and tetrahedrons), but has limited support for meshes consisting of quadrilateral (quad) and hexahedral (hex) cells. Finite element problems solved on quad/hex meshes often have better approximation properties and better robustness to cell distortion than those solved on simplex meshes. The project idea aims at being able to assemble and solve the simplest PDE, a Poisson's equation, in 2D (quad mesh) and 3D (hex mesh) in FEniCS.","assignee_display_names":["Christopher Richardson","Jack S.

Our technologies enable researchers to assemble and analyze these networks and to use them to better understand biological systems and, in particular, how they fail in disease. \n\nThe NRNB mentoring organization includes projects such as [Cytoscape](http://cytoscape.org/), [WikiPathways](http://wikipathways.org/), [SBML](http://sbml.org/), and [cBioPortal](http://cbioportal.org/). *This is a great opportunity to work at the intersection of biology and computing!* For example, Cytoscape is downloaded over **16,000 times per month** by researchers. We take mentoring seriously and are proud of our [>90% success rate](http://www.nrnb.org/alumni.html#gsoc-tab) with former students and projects. But don't take our word for it, read testimonials from prior NRNB students [students](http://www.nrnb.org/testimonials.html#student-tab) and [mentors](http://www.nrnb.org/testimonials.html#mentor-tab).\n\nFind out more about the software projects being developed in coordination with NRNB.
